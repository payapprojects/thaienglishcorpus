Study of Solidification Shrinkage Behavior in Cast Irons by Linear Displacement Method
This research aims to study the solidification behavior in Gray Iron (GI), Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) and Ductile Iron (DI). 
In order to achieve this goal, the special equipment was devised by applying a linear displacement method. 
The equipment consisted of spherical additive-manufactured sand molds encased in steel jackets. 
The jackets were equipped with a thermocouple and quartz rod (connected to the LVDT) to record the temperature and the displacement simultaneously. 
Irons with various Carbon Equivalent (CE) 3.7, 4.0, 4.3 and 4.6 were produced for this experiment. 
It was found that the contraction and the expansion behaviors of three types of cast irons exhibited slight differences. 
The graphite expansion and graphite expansion time increased with increasing carbon equivalent ranged from 0.2–1.8 mm and 230–450 s respectively. 
In addition, the austenite shrinkage was observed for some conditions at CE lower than 4.3. No significant difference was seen between types of irons.
