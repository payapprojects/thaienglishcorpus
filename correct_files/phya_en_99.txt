Put your hand above your head, slowly turn around, reobserve the nipples and the side of your breasts
Hands on the hips, the elbows turned outwards, slightly bent your body to the front, see the changes.
Use your hand to gently squeeze the nipples to see if there are any bleeding ,pus or  liquid.
Grope your breast form collarbone area, use your left hand touch the right breast. 
And the index, the middle and the ring fingers lightly press on the skin and gradually press harder until your fingers can feel the rib.
