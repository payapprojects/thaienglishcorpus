This study was a descriptive research aiming to investigate the relationships among personal factors,learned resourcefulness and psychological self-care behavior. 
The learned resourcefulness theory ofRosenbaum (1983, 1990) was used as a conceptual framework of the study. 
The subjects consisted of 110patients with coronary artery disease receiving medical care at the Outpatient Department, Chest DiseaseInstitute, Nonthaburi Province from October to November 2004. 
Data were collected by means of interviewsbased on the demographic characteristic questionnaire, self-control schedule, and psychological self-carebehavior questionnaire. 
Data analysis included descriptive statistics and Pearson's Product Moment Correlation. 
The finding coefficient revealed that education level is the only factor that had a positive correlation withlearned resourcefulness at the moderate level (r = 0.36; p < 0.01) and with psychological self-care behaviorat the low level (r = 0.21; p < 0.05). 
Learned resourcefulness had positive correlation with psychologicalself-care behavior at a fairly high level (r = 0.59; p < 0.01). 
Based on these findings, it is recommended that nurses should seek strategies for promote learnedresourcefulness, leading to psychological self care behavior. 
Moreover, there should be a nursing service thatenhances learned resourcefulness and psychological self-care behavior in patients with coronary artery diseasewho are educated at a low level.
