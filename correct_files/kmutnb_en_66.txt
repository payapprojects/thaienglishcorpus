Dispersion of Basalt Fibers in Solution
A study of basalt fibers dispersion in solution was to find the suitable conditions of dispersion. 
Using basalt fibers is the other way to decrease asbestos which is dangerous for human health. 
The problem of using basalt fibers in construction material was agglomeration of fibers. 
The investigation of dispersion can solve this problem. 
This work measured the electrical resistivity and turbidity of solution which were the indicator of basalt fibers dispersion. 
The comparison of various ratio of basalt fibers and water found that at 1% by weight the dispersion was good. 
Carboxy Methyl Cellulose (CMC) improved the dispersion. 
At the same pH and ratio of dispersant, the electrical resistivity of CMC was lower than of latex. 
pH at 5, 7 and 9 did not affect to the electrical resistivity as using CMC.
