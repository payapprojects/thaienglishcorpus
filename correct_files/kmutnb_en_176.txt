The Impact of Inrush Current from Medium Voltage Capacitor Banks Switching: A Case Study of MEA
Increasing the stability of the power system is one of the methods used in the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA). 
This method compensates the reactive power from switching the capacitor banks into the electrical system by using a circuit breaker to connect the capacitor bank. 
From the switching a high level of inrush current will be generated which can cause serious damage to the capacitor bank. 
Therefore, this study investigates the impact of inrush current using circuit breaker to connect the capacitor bank by modeling electrical system with ATP-EMTP transient analysis program. 
The result of the study reveals that the current and voltage while switching the capacitor bank can be determined the effect of switching on two cases. 
Case 1: The simulation of switching power supply capacitor bank for one set showed that the peak current was 1.610 kA in phase A at 90 and 270 degrees and the maximum voltage in phase A was 16.751 kV at 90 and 270 degrees. 
Case 2: the simulation of switching power supply capacitor bank for set together with another capacitor bank, showed the peak current was 1.829 kA at 90 and 270 degrees in phase A and the maximum voltage in phase A was 17.832 kV at 90 and 270 degrees.
