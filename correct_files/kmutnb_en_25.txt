From the flood situation in Thailand, 2554, a large number of victims had a trouble in evacuating from affected areas to save places. 
Due to the height of flood level, only special high vehicle can be used for evacuation during flood. 
Based on this problem, we want to solve the problem of vehicle routing for evacuation during flood situation. 
The objective is to determine the vehicle routes, for moving victims from affected areas to safe places during flood disaster, with the shortest total evacuation time. 
We solved the problem by constructing a Mathematical Model, which was developed based on the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). 
The proposed model considered two types of victims, which are regular victims and special help needed victims. 
We tested the proposed model with a case study area in Ladsawai Sub district, Lumlukka District, Pathumthani Province. 
The experiments were divided into 10 cases, by fixing the proportion of victims in each village wanted to evacuate at 10%, 20% and 30%, and by considering 3 flood levels at 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 meters. 
The last case, case 10, was the vehicle routing similar to the one used during flood in 2014. 
The output of the model showed the shortest total evacuation times (depended on travelled distance and loading time), the number of vehicles needed, and the routes that each vehicle took to evacuate the victims. 
This result can be used as a guideline for the vehicle route management planning when the next flood occurs.
