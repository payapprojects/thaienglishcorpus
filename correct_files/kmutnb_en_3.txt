Development of Babbler’s Bill Leaf Carragenan Jellies
The aim of this research was to develop herbal jelly from Babbler’s Bill Leaf. 
Several conditions affecting the jelly’s qualities were studied, such as the amount of carrageenan and sugar, and the ratio of water to Babbler’s Bill leaf. 
From this research a suitable formula was composed of Babbler’s Bill leaf extract (ratio of water to fresh Babbler’s Bill leaf was 95 : 5) at 82.97%, sugar at 14.85%, carrageenan at 1.98%, and citric acid at 0.025%. 
The moisture content of the final product was 85.19 and the water activity (aw) was 0.989. 
The texture properties of the developed product were hardness at 70.06 g., cohesiveness at 0.51, Gumminess at 20.04 g, springiness at 0.30, and color properties were L* 26.49, a* –2.57, and b* 8.12. Finally, there was no microbial growth detected.
