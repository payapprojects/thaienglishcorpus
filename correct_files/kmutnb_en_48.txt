This research studied the chloride diffusion coefficient of recycled aggregate concretes containing fly ash exposed to marine environment for 3 years. 
Mae-Moh fly ash were used to replace Portland cement at the percentages of 0, 15, 25, 35, and 50 by weight of binder with the water to binder (W/B) ratios of 0.40, 0.45, and 0.50 in the mixtures. 
Concrete cube specimens of 200×200×200 mm3 were cast and placed in the tidal zone of marine environment for 3 years. 
Chloride diffusion coefficients of the specimens were determined according to Fick’s second law of diffusion. 
The research found that chloride diffusion coefficients of recycled aggregate concretes containing fly ash were significantly lower than those of recycled aggregate concretes without any fly ash. 
Smaller in W/B ratio also lessened chloride penetration coefficient especially in recycled aggregate concretes without any fly ash. 
Considering ACI 201.2R recommendation, use of Mae-Moh fly ash to replace Portland cement between 15 and 25 percent by weight of binder with the W/B ratio of 0.40 in the mixture would be suggested to satisfy both compressive strength and chloride penetration resistance of recycled aggregate concretes exposed to marine environment.
