Oxford Business College is an independent education and training establishment specialising in a range of higher-level business management courses, offering those embarking on their careers a route to degree, postgraduate or professional qualifications (awarded by Buckinghamshire New University and the University for the Creative Arts).
The qualifications that can be obtained include: Foundation Diplomas in Business Management, Engineering, and Law, which are designed to give international students a pathway to British universities; the BTEC Higher National Certificate in Business (level 4, the equivalent of the first year at university); and BTEC Higher National Diploma in Business (level 5, corresponding to the first two years at university); plus a BA (Hons) in Business Management, a BA (Hons) in Business Management with Foundation Year, and an International MBA, all of which are awarded by the University for the Creative Arts and Bucks New University. 
In addition, our Business English Language Preparation programme (BELP) is offered for durations of anything from one week to nine months. 
Whether students are looking for a short break to improve their English, or an intensive programme to prepare them for their next academic or professional step, the BELP can be tailored to suit all.
The College is situated in the centre of Oxford, and therefore in a perfect position for students to enjoy all the tremendous attributes this global capital of education has to offer.
