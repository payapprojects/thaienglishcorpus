Private boarding schools in prestigious London locations since 1952 – Kensington, Notting Hill, Chelsea. 
We teach GCSEs, A levels, and Foundation, and our students achieve outstanding results and progress to the UK’s top universities.
We offer more than 40 A Level subjects, and provide specialist preparation for students aiming for the most competitive degree subjects, at the highest ranking universities.
Small, focused classes (average class size of 8 students), weekly exam practice with comprehensive and constructive feedback, and a dedicated personal tutor for every student, to ensure our students achieve their personal academic goals.
There is a full programme of extra-curricular activities, including sports, cultural activities, societies, and subject-related excursions.
Whilst we have students of 39 different nationalities, it is important to us that over 75% of our students are British, so our international students benefit from studying alongside British students.
We provide full board accommodation, and have the highest standards of welfare to ensure our students feel safe, comfortable and happy.
