Silver Removal from Computer Keyboards with Metallic Replacement
This research aims to study the removal of silver from computer keyboards with the metallic replacement. 
The computer keyboards are separated and soaked in various concentration of nitric acid, different reaction times and temperatures as to determine the optimal conditions. 
As a result, the amount of silver removal from the 1:15 ratio of the computer keyboard to 3 M nitric acid, at 50Â°C, with 8 hr. 
operation time is demonstrated at 2.65 percent by mass. 
The quality of the silver analyzed with X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) is 100% pure. 
The operating cost for silver removal from computer keyboards with the metallic replacement is 76.39 Baht for one gram of silver.
