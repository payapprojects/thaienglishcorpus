Reducing Sugar Production from Empty Fruit Bunches with Enzyme Cellic Ctec2®
Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch (OPEFB) was an agricultural residue that consists mostly of lignocellulosic material (57.88% cellulose, 23.81% hemicellulose and 16.51% lignin by weight). 
In this study, OPEFB was pretreated with 10, 15 and 20% (w/v) of sodium hydroxide for 60 minutes. 
The best pretreatment of OPEFB was 15% of sodium hydroxide. 
The result of pretreatment showed that the percentage of cellulose increased by 14.28% and the percentages of lignin decreased by 3.41%. 
After that, the pretreated OPEFB was hydrolyzed by Cellic Ctec2®enzyme with substrate loading of 5, 7, 10 and 15% (w/v), enzyme loading of 20 FPU/g substrate and 140 rpm for 5 days. 
The highest reducing sugar from OPEFB was 85.79 g·L–1 by using 10% substrate loading for 5 days. 
The reducing sugar consists of 60.29 g/L of glucose and 12.51 g/L of xylose by HPLC analysis.
