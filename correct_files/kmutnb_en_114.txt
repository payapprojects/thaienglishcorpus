On Fuzzy Subsets in Abel-Grassmann’s Semirings
Let R be an Abel-Grassmann’s semiring. 
In this paper, we introduce the concept of a fuzzy subset, fuzzy left and fuzzy right ideals in Abel-Grassmann’s semirings, and to study fuzzy left and fuzzy right ideals in Abel-Grassmann’s semirings. 
We show that a non empty subset I of R is an Abel-Grassmann’s subsemiring (left ideal, right ideal, ideal) if and only if fI (tfI) is a fuzzy Abel-Grassmann’s subsemiring (fuzzy left ideal, fuzzy right ideal, fuzzy ideal) of R. 
Finally we show that f is a fuzzy Abel-Grassmann’s subsemiring (fuzzy left ideal, fuzzy right ideal, fuzzy ideal) of R if and only if U (f, t) is an Abel-Grassmann’s subsemiring (left ideal, right ideal, ideal) of R.
