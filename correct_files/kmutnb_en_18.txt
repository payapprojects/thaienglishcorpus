Development of Kineet Guided Senior Citizen Following Robot by Fuzzy Control
Currently, the number of senior citizens who live alone in Thailand has increased continuously. 
Accordingly, this research aims to develop Kinect guided senior citizen following robot by fuzzy control for making decision on robot’s movement. 
Firstly, the researcher conducted a test to find the best interval for detecting senior citizen in order to determine the range of robot’s movement control through fuzzy control. 
A participant of this test was requested to stand in Calibration Pose at the defined position and the result was analyzed by using Analysis of Variance at 95% confidence interval. 
The results showed that the quantity of skeleton was properly detected at −50 centimeters to 50 centimeters on X axis and 200 centimeters to 250 centimeters on Z axis. 
Subsequently, the researcher designed the fuzzy system by setting the robot to detect the center between shoulders then 2 input variables and 2 output variables (including X error, Z error, motor speed of left wheel, and motor speed of right wheel, respectively) were determined. 
Moreover, Center of Gravity Method was also utilized for averaging results obtained from interpretation. 
In conclusion, this Kinect guided senior citizen following robot by fuzzy control was able to follow senior citizens greatly. 
The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on X axis is 11.355 and Z axis is 8.548 respectively
