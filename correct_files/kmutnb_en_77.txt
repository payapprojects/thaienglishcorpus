The objective of this study was to examine the optimum conditions for coffee oil extraction from used coffee grounds (UCG) of Coffea canephora var. 
robusta and Coffea arabica with hexane solvent through response surface methodology. 
The operating variables of the extraction process were optimized by Central Composite Design (CCD), a subset of Response Surface Methodology (RSM), and it was analyzed by Minitab R.17 software. 
The factors in this study including solvent to solid ratio (4 : 1–8 : 1 mL/g), extraction temperature (35–45ºC) and extraction time (15–45 min), a five-level rotatable CCD were used for experimental design. 
A total of experimental conditions was 20 experiments. 
These data were analyzed by non-linear quadratic correlation model. 
The experimental results showed that each factor was correlated significantly with the other factors. 
The optimum variables of extraction were as follows: solvent to solid ratio of 8.14 mL/g, extraction temperature of 46.97ºC and extraction time of 27.22 minutes, and the maximum oil yielded under these conditions was 13.04%. 
The experiments performed under these conditions showed that the extracted oil yield was up to 13.08±0.20%, which related accurately with the prediction value. 
The extracted coffee oil was characterized for their properties of free fatty acids, density, and viscosity. 
The acid value of the extracted oil was about 3.70 mgNaOH/gOil suitable for esterification process. 
The oil properties revealed the viscosity (49.65 cP at 40ºC) and the density of about 948 kg/m3.at 15ºC.
