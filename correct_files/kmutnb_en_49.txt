According to CO2 emission has increased up to now and it is a causes of the global warming in the consequence. 
CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage) is an effective tool to mitigate CO2 emission, but surface uplifting due to reservoir expansion is a problem caused by CSS project that needs to be concerned. 
This research aims to studies and shows a significant property of the fluids that are injected into suitable reservoirs in order to mitigate global warming problems. 
The laboratory tests and the geomechanical model are simulated rock deformations caused by CO2 injection for CCS projects. 
The results show that the different fluid properties produced the different rock deformations. 
The fluids that has a high mobility and penetration resulted a high number of the rock deformations. 
Consequently, the pore pressure is not a single factor for a calculation of the rock deformations, the fluid property also plays an important role for the rock deformation and should be paid more attention.
