Factors of Machining with Milling Tool TiAIN Coated Solid Carbide Finishing End Mill Affecting Life Time of Cutting Edge and Surface Roughness
This study aimed to identify factors in the Soloid Carbide Finishing End Mill (TiAlN) affecting to the utilization duration of cutting by considering the test machining medium carbon steel (S45C) Factors affecting the utilization duration of cutting are spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut. 
In addition, factors that affect the cutting are also occurring from direction, overlap and coolant. 
Therefore, this research is conducted by controlled experiments the cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut and determining three factors include overlap, cut direction and coolant. 
The surface roughness variable could define the standard of milling surface roughness (Ra) â‰¤1.6 micrometers which uses constant speed at 1500 rpm. 
by setting 2 level include overlap at 2 mm and 4 mm. 
Moreover, setting climb milling, conventional milling, and coolant by controlling as closed and reopened are important to the utilization duration. 
The study found that the significant of cut direction, Overlap, and coolant on life time of cutting edge is .05. 
The best outcome can be achieved by using two millimeters overlap, climb milling and open coolant. 
The factory cost reduced when selecting an appropriate factor.
