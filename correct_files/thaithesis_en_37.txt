This objective of this thesis, the Development ofDistributed Files on the DECnet Network (DDFDN), was todevelop the file distribution protocol for computer systemswith centralized processing used in many businessorganizations. 
The development was intended to keep theexisting application programs unchanged, to make any changetransparent to the users, and to increase the ability of thesystems to handle more data and users. 
The DDFDN was mainlydeveloped for implementation on the Ethernet-based computernetwork using DECnet protocol and was tested with ManagementInformation System for Cellular Services computer network atThe Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT). 
This thesis employs the structure analysis and designas the analysis tool to distribute files through out thenetwork. 
The DECnet protocol was used to access filesremotely. 
The test program to measure response-time andload-capacity was developed by using COBOL program andparameter. 
The use of system processing time and powerbefore and after using DDFDN in the system was recorded byutility program of VMS operating system. 
By testing DDFDN with the small prototype DECnetcomputer network, the testing result shows that afterdeploying DDFDN, the response time was 145% faster and theload-capacity (system ability) was improved about 80% whencompared to the original network. 
Then, the DDFDN was portedto test in the CAT's Management Information System forCellular Services computer network. 
The testing result wasstill the same, and also indicates that the computer networkhas more resource available and the users get no effect.
