Two-dimension Flim Cutting by Quality Grade
The plastic film manufacturing industry: One of the manufacturing processes, including cutting the film to the size that according to customer requirements, due to a variety of customers, including width, length, grade and due date, etc. 
This research aims to 1) form a mathematical model that use the genetic algorithm that create the optimizing patterns. 
2) Developing the cutting film programs which following the patterns speed performance that had developed by the generating pattern and the application speed in the context of the cutting blade changed. 
To find the guidelines of the research on Two−dimension Film Cutting by Quality Grade, the first step is to studies the genetic algorithm theory related research and education in the management of the cutting two−dimensional material as much as possible. 
The second step is to analyze the research in the context of the proposed research. 
The third step is to educate deeply in the research context. 
Step four is synthesizing the mathematical model. 
The fifth is testing the feasibility of the mathematical model that synthesis. 
Step six Programming and testing with the actually work. 
Step seven testing with the human computation. 
And the eighth compare and analyze the results from the management’s technology with the old ways that is used the human computing. 
The result on this research that is developed by the synthesized mathematical model decreased the calculating time when compare with the man is 51 times (5185%) and reduce blades changed time in the manufacturing 13 percent less on average.
