Design of a Database Program for Reducing Searching Time of History and Detail of Container Mainte
The objective of this research was to reduce the time needed to search thehistory of container maintenance by using a database program. 
The research is a case study of a transport and distribution center company in Thailand. 
The maintenance department in charge of the containers has a number of files for recording container maintenance, and this database program can help to search the maintenance records more quickly and conveniently. 
According to the results of an on-site test, by comparing the search time for the existing system and the new system, it was seen that the new system reduced the search time from 4 minutes 43 seconds (283 second) to 55 seconds. 
This means that the search time was reduced by 80.57%, which makes it more convenient to search the history of container maintenance.
