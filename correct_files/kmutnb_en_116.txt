Bottom-spray Fluidized Bed Coating: Effect of Process Variables on Rice Kernel Coating Efficiency
The purpose of this study was to construct a small scale batch bottom-spray fluidized bed coating apparatus. 
The effects of several process variables on the coating efficiency were evaluated. 
Coating experiments were performed by spraying turmeric extract solution onto Jasmine rice kernels. 
The experimental conditions were solution spray rates of 30, 35 and 40 mL/min, atomization pressure of 1 and 1.5 bar, spray time of 8 and 10 min, time of drying after spraying of 30 and 10 sec, superficial air velocity of 2.5 m/s, drying temperatures of 55, 60 and 65°C and 80% of recycle air. 
The coated rice quality was evaluated in terms of the moisture content, color, percentage of fissure kernels and coating efficiency. 
The experimental results have shown that suitable conditions for producing turmeric extract coated rice were drying temperature of 55°C, the coating solution spray rate of 40 mL/min, atomization pressure of 1.5 bar, spray time of 8 min and time of drying after spraying of 10 sec. 
The color of turmeric extract coated rice was reddish-yellow. 
The moisture content of turmeric extract coated rice decreased with increasing the drying temperature, coating solution spray time and time of drying after spraying. 
The increase of the drying temperature and coating solution spray rate did not affect the percentage of fissure kernels. 
The coating efficiency of the apparatus was in the range of 78.2–82.9%.
