Predictive Maintenance for Centrifugal Pumps in Pulp Industry
Centrifugal pumps are commonly used in the process for making paper pulp. 
Pump failure may result in the production process disruption. 
Maintenance and troubleshooting of centrifugal pumps play a key role in reducing such failure. 
Despite all the care in preventive maintenance, some unexpected failures can still be found. 
Generally the failure are caused by unrelated timetable for typical inspection and 3 equipment parameters, i.e. the priority queue, a pumpâ€™s operational lifetime and workload. 
This research aims to determine the appropriate time period recommended for pump inspection through predictive maintenance and pump vibration analysis as to determine its mechanical condition. 
The relationships between the vibration values obtained and the three main parameters were carried out. 
Studying steps are 1) grouping the pumps by these parameters; 2) measuring the vibration of the bearing, and then observing its changes for a reliable prediction of upcoming inspection periods; 3) performance monitoring and inspecting based on the of the forecast period. 
As potential problems are identified, preventive maintenance can be be administered and performed properly; 4) calculating the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and the Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). 
The results show that the proper time periods for regular inspection and maintenance are every 7 days, every 15 days and every 30 days. 
As the procedures were completed as the indicated time, the MTBF of the pumps in water treatment unit was found to increase to 724 hours (50.16%), and the MTTR of pumps in Brownstock unit reduced to 12.02 minutes (13.19%).
