Allergic diseases are one of the most common conditions in children. 
They can be caused by exposure to anything from food to the environment. 
Some of the most common food allergens are cowâ€™s milk, eggs, peanuts and seafood while common environmental allergens in Thailand are dust mites, cockroaches and pets.
