Epidemic disease outbreak has long been one of themore critical problems of Thai society, bringing with itgreat loss of lives. 
Since Thai elites during the pre-modernera lacked basic public health knowledge, they often couldnot prevent the recurrence of disease outbreaks. 
During the reign of Rama III, the King and the Thaielite started acquiring western knowledge and technology,including modern medicine, and in particular, etiology, andthus realized that diseases originated in microbes, not inkarma or supernatural power. 
From this scientific basis as well as an awareness ofthe critical role of human resources in national developmentand social reform during this reign, a rudimentary epidemicdisease prevention program was introduced. 
This wasaccomplished through the proclamation of a number of royaldecrees on sanitation and public health, and through theestablishment of health guarantines and modern medicalfacilities throughout the country. 
The effort of the government in preventing theoutbreak of epidemic diseases, though initially not wellunderstood by the public at large, has helped lay down asolid foundation for later development of both outbreakprevention and public health in Thailand.
