This study investigates and develops a process of fact handling in the legal expert system involving a court hearing process and a process of an argumentation between a plaintiff and a defendant. 
To develop a legal expert system, it is necessary to prepare a legal knowledge base and a set of facts for the system to deduce a legal reasoning to get the legal conclusion. 
In the legal expert system, user will input a set of facts to obtain a legal result from the system. 
In this work, we design a legal knowledge base and implement to handle a conflicted fact which is occurred from the input of the user. 
Moreover, we propose a process to manage estoppel which is a fact that Thai law does not allow a party to prove. 
The legal knowledge created from Thai Civil and Commercial Code law and the test cases are obtained from Thai Supreme court sentences. 
We compared the results of the proposed legal expert system with a traditional legal expert system. 
The results show that the proposed legal expert system can give correct legal result and adjudication. 
Moreover, the system can reduce the steps of a burden of proof from O(n) to O(1).
