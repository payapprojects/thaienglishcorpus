Asymptotic Confidence Ellipses for Length-biased Inverse Gaussian Distribution
The length-biased inverse Gaussian distribution has been useful in statistics. 
This distribution has been used in extensive applications, for example, physics, engineering, and biology. 
It is suited for the rightskewed data analysis. 
In this research, we are interested in studying the maximum likelihood equations and finding the Fisher information matrix to construct asymptotic confidence ellipse for the length-biased inverse Gaussian distribution by comparing a coverage probability with a confidence coefficient of 0.98 of confidence ellipses for cases of sample sizes n = 10, 20, 30, 50, 60, 100, 500, and 1,000 parameter λ = 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and parameter μ = 1. 
Monte Carlo simulations are considered with 10,000 iterations by using program R (3.4.3).
