The purposes of this study were to develop a confidence interval of different median for two Population with Free-distributions by Price Bonett Boostrap-t method and compare the perfomance of the proposed Price Bonett Boostrap-t method with other methods. 
Simulation by the Monte Carlo technique is repeated 5,000 times in the case of calculation of median confidence intervals using the bootstrap technique. 
The rounds of random sampling with the bootstrap method are 5,000 times, which simulates both data from the population with free-distributions and the size of each sample by using the R program. 
The results indicated that the Price Bonett Boostrap-t method performance was better than the Price Bonett method and Percentile Bootstrap method which were 17 from 24 situations of this study.
