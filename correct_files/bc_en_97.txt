The Aims of The Course
Let’s face it! Movies are cool! They illustrate & define culture, they open our eyes to the world and they are good fun to watch. 
There are so many films from all over the world, but sometimes the speaking can be fast & the grammar and vocabulary difficult. 
-Would you like to be better able to understand & talk about films in English? 
-Would you like to be better able to debate & give your opinions on a range of topics in conversation & through presentations? 
-How about taking part in interactive simulations of real life situations ? 
-Yes? 
-Then our Songkran courses are for you. 
Our film-based courses focus have been specially prepared by teachers at the British Council to fit the particular needs of Thai learners & focus on developing all four language skills: reading, listening, writing and speaking. 
The fun and varied activities will allow you to develop your confidence and independence in using English.
