How to Improve Their Writing Skills?
Let your children do some activities that require hand moving. 
Some parents will not let their kids picking up things by hand as they think kids might take a toy to put in their mouth such including not allowing them to grab a fork for eating as well as brushing teeth and finger paint or unpacking candy package etc.  
When children turn around 4-5 , they would start using various writing devices for example using pencil to draw pictures or write. 
Parents should help motivate them to feel enjoyable with the activity not specifically tell them where the drawing should start so that they could be more creative and relaxed during learning process.
Parents have to respond to what the children really need for example, when children do not understand doing something parents must send positive reinforcement to children by motivating them with complimenting or inspiring to make them accomplish the activities and want to do it again next time.
