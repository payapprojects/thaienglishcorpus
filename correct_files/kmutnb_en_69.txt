Performance Improvement for Gas Turbine by Inlet Air Cooling Method
This paper studies the performance improvement for gas turbine with a capacity of 292 MW by applying the inlet air cooling method. 
The effect of operating conditions on the performance of gas turbine is simulated by using the computational program, Aspen Hysys version 8.6. 
The simulation was verified with the actual modified operating condition at the ambient air temperature of 34Â°C and the relative humidity of 49%. 
The current study compares the effect of inlet air cooling in 3 cases which are 1) Normal operation (without the inlet air cooling system), 2) With the fogging spray system, 3) With the electric chiller system. 
The results indicated that the gas turbine with the fogging spray system and the electric chiller system can increase the power output by 7.02% and 13%, respectively.
