Colon Capsule
Capsule colonoscopy is a procedure similar to the capsule endoscopy for the small intestine. 
The major difference is that the colon capsule is equipped with two cameras on either side.
This produces images from more angles according to the difference in the size of the colon and the small intestine. 
After the procedure, the images and data are analyzed by computer to determine a quick and accurate treatment plan and an accurate cause of the disease.
