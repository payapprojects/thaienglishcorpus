We are a genuine seven day a week full boarding school as over 80% of our pupils are full boarders and we don't offer weekly or flexi boarding. 
We have over 200 UK boarders and approximately 100 International students. 
The majority of our International students come from within the EU and we currently only have 14 students from Mainland China, 7 from Hong Kong and 2 from Russia. 
Academic standards are high and the majority of our leavers progress to top universities.
