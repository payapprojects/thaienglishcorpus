Synthesis of Carbon Nanomaterials Using Stainless Steel Type 304 as Substrate and Catalyst by Chemical Vapor Deposition Method
This research aim is to study the direct synthesis of carbon nanomaterials by chemical vapor depositionusing 304 stainless steel as both catalyst and substrate at 650Â°C. 
The ratio of mixing gases (acetylene, hydrogen and nitrogen) in chamber is controlled to constant value at 1:1:2 with a total flow rate of 400 ml/min for 20 min. 
Besides that, the surface treatment of 304 stainless steel substrate was performed in the atmospheric of hydrogen and nitrogen before providing acetylene as a carbon source for 15 min. 
The microphotograph results from FE-SEM and TEM can be used in order to investigate the physical morphology of the obtained carbon nanomaterials. 
Three types of carbon nanomaterials that can be synthesized are carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers and bamboo carbon nanotubes.
