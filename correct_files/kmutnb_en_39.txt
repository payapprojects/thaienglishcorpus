Scientific and Technical Workforce Requirements in Thailand
Thai industry has been growing rapidly since 1961. 
We classify this development into 4 phases: 1) labor intensive, 2) capital intensive, 3) technology intensive and 4) knowledge intensive. 
We use proportions of basic skilled workers to technical skilled workers as milestones for the phase indicator. 
In this paper, we discuss the vitality of workforce in Thai industrial development, specifically scientific and technical workforce. 
We discover that over 70 percent of Thai labors are non-skilled workers in addition to the immense demand for workforce holding high vocational certificates or university level qualifications.
