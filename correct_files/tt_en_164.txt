The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to determine the effectiveness of a health education program which applied Self-Efficacy Theory on self-care among cerebrovascular patients attending services at Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Medical College and Vajira Hospital.
The sample group consisted of SO patients who participated in the designated program activities three times. 
The program concentrated on developing knowledge on cerebrovascular disease, improving self-esteem, perceived self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and self-care practice. 
An interview was used for data collection which was conducted from September 2001 to December 2001. 
Statistical analysis was performed using frequency, mean, percentage, standard deviation and paired samples t-test. 
The results of this study revealed that after the program, the experimental group had significantly better knowledge, self=esteem, perceived self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and self-care practice of relaxation than before the program. 
The mean score had increased for exercise and taking medicine, but it was not a significant difference.
