Effect of Copper and Iron Loading on Zeolite Y for Carbon Dioxide Adsorption
The concentration of carbon dioxide is increasing significantly and it affected global warming. 
Therefore; this research was to study CO2 adsorption and metal loading on zeolite Y. 
Bagasse ash was used as a source of silica instead of sodium silicate for NaY synthesis. 
CO2 adsorption efficiency was improved using copper and iron loading into zeolite via incipient wetness impregnation method. 
The results showed that at 300°C with 5.5 wt.%Cu/Zeolite Y could adsorb 67.06% of CO2 and 1 wt.%Fe/Zeolite Y could adsorb 61.14%. 
Moreover, Cu and Fe loading with 5.5wt%Cu-1wt.%Fe/Zeolite Y reached high CO2 adsorption at 82.40%. 
For the adsorption temperature of 100°C, 300°C and 600°C, the highest efficiency of CO2 adsorption was at 100°C.
