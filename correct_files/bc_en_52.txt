UK Further Education
Not sure you’re ready for a Bachelor’s degree? 
Interested in both academic and vocational courses?
Enrol at a UK further education college. 
You can gain a UK Higher Education qualification such as a Higher National Diploma (HND), enhance your career prospects, and still top-up to a university degree later.
Why choose the UK further education?
If you would like to study in the UK and want to keep your options flexible, a course at a UK further education college could be the solution.
UK further education (FE) colleges are funded by the Government and offer access courses, higher education-level diplomas and in some cases full Bachelor’s degrees. 
College qualifications are designed to equip students with job-specific skills that they can transfer into the workplace, boosting their employability. 
They are designed in close partnership with employers, thereby ensuring a competitive edge and exposure to the latest industry.
UK college diplomas such as HNDs are often more affordable than other types of courses and offer articulation pathways to Bachelor’s degrees at a range of universities. 
Completion of an HND is considered equivalent to the second year of a university degree in the UK. 
In addition, many UK FE colleges also offer higher education qualifications in direct partnership with universities.
Studying at a college is a different experience to studying at university.
College class sizes are generally smaller than at university and you will probably be in more timetabled classes. 
A college course is a great way to prepare for independent study and learning, progressing to university later if you choose to. 
There are colleges located all across the UK, in big cities, small towns and rural areas.
