Application of Artificial Neural Networks with Fast Fourier Transform for Waveform Analysis and Classification
This research presents electrical signal waveforms analysis and classification by applying the principle and theory of supervised artificial neural network. 
The input data for training and testing the network were processed by using Fast Fourier Transform. 
There are three input variables and one output for the network. 
From the experiment to determine the number of nodes in the hidden layer in order to obtain the optimal Mean Square Errors (MSE) for analyzing signals, the back propagation learning, training function, TrainLM and learning function along with LearnGDM were used. 
The experimental result found that the best network consisted of the optimal number of nodes at 3-40-1, input nodes, hidden nodes and the output node respectively. 
The transfer functions for hidden layer and output layer were logsig and purelin function respectively. 
The optimal MSE of training process was 1.45E-08. 
The MSE of the test was 1.54E-08, which provides the highest percentage of Efficiency Index (EI) in the testing process. 
The noise levels were added to the input data for testing the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
The satisfactory noise levels were not more than 5% of the input data. 
From the test, it showed that the proposed artificial neural network can be used in signal pattern recognition as a means of signal fault analysis and classification.
