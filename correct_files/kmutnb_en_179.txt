Dyeing of Nano Carbon and Titanium Dioxide Coated Monk Robes Using Natural Dye Powder
This research intends to developed nano carbon and titanium dioxide coated monk robes dyeing with natural dye powder. 
The physical property of cotton, silk and muslin fabrics coated with nano carbon and titanium dioxide were investigated. 
The antifungal, antibacterial and UV protection properties were also characterized. 
Cotton, silk and muslin fabrics coated with nano carbon and titanium dioxide could inhibited both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. 
Light fastness properties of cotton, silk and muslin fabrics without coated and coated with nano carbon and titanium dioxide dyed with Allium ascalonicum Linn. 
and Gareinia dulcis Kurz average level were 3–4 (moderate to good) and washing fastness properties average were 4–5 (good to very good). 
The ability to prevent UVA and UVB rays of cotton, silk and muslin fabrics coated with nano carbon and titanium dioxide with ratios 0.01 : 0.49 (g) reflected the UPF value of UV protection was more than 50, with the maximum UV protection (over 98 percent) and had percent transmittance of an ultraviolet B rays of ≤2.5.
