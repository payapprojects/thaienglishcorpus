Extra-Curricular Services
The British Council's global network of offices in 110 countries and territories, as well as our integral role within the UK's education sector, makes us a gateway for partnering institutions and their students to ASEAN, the United Kingdom and the wider international community. 
Throughout the year we support our partners by involving them in local and international competitions, festivals, programmes and events. 
These include the UK's Reading Challenge, our global art competition, anti-bullying and child protection initiatives, and visits by leading international authors, artists and educational experts. 
Our Connecting Classrooms scheme puts Thai students in contact with their peers in British schools, while our Inspire! Scholarships and School Lab competition offers the chance to study in the UK.
We seek to become trusted partners, performing an integral and valued role within each institution, offering additional services such as teacher training, workshops for parents, libraries, online and digital support, and after-school clubs.
