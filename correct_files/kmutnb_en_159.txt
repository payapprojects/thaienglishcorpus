This research studied the effect of fly ash on chloride diffusion coefficient and compressive strength of both recycled and natural aggregate concretes exposed to marine environment for 5 years. 
Mae-Moh fly ash was used to replace Portland cement at the percentages of 0, 15, 25, 35, and 50 by the weight of binder with various water to binder (W/B) ratios of 0.40 and 0.45 in recycled aggregate mixtures and a W/B ratio of 0.45 in natural aggregate mixtures. 
Concrete cube specimens of 200×200×200 mm3 were cast and cured in fresh water for 28 days and then were placed in a tidal zone of marine environment. 
The compressive strengths of the concrete exposed to marine environment for 5 years as well as the total chloride diffusion coefficients of the specimens were determined. 
The Results revealed that the compressive strengths of recycled aggregate concretes decreased after being exposed in marine environment for 5 years, whereas those of natural aggregate concretes and fly ash increased after 28 days of curing. 
Evidently, higher in fly ash contents would lower chloride diffusion coefficients of both recycled and natural aggregate concretes. 
Furthermore, use of fly ash as low as 15% replacement by weight in recycled aggregated concretes could provide lower chloride diffusion coefficient compared to Portland cement containing natural aggregate concrete with W/B of 0.45.
