The Development Model of Energy Manager’s Potential in Industrial Plants
The aim of this research is to study the factors that are essential for energy managers and to scrutinize the crucial factors contributing to their success. 
A development model was developed regarding the energy manager’s potential and a handbook was created that would assist with the development of energy managers in industrial plants. 
The Delphi method was used on a sample of 21 experts, and the research instruments consisted of questionnaires and interviews, with statistical data analyzed utilizing frequency, percentage, median, and IQR (Interquartile Range). 
The obtained results suggested the format for the development of energy managers’ potential consisting of three core competencies, each consisting of various sub-competencies. 
The three core competencies were knowledge, skills, and attributes. 
Knowledge consisted of seven sub-competencies, skills consisted of six sub-competencies, and attributes consisted of seven sub-competencies. 
Evaluations of the “Guidelines for the Development of the Potential of the Energy Manager” and the handbook “The development of the Potential of the Energy Manager in Industrial Plants” by thirteen specialists provided unanimous approval of their applicable use.
