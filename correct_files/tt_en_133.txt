Objectives : 
To determine the prevalence of hyperlipidemia,hyperinsulinemia and to identify the relationship of fat patterning,familial history of hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease, diabetesmellitus to hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia. 
Design : Observational study design.	
Setting: 
Pediatric department of King Chulalongkorn hospital andBangkok Christian school. 
Target populations : 
Children and adolescents age between 4-16years, who had body weight greater than 120% of percent weight for height,and did not have any endocrine disease, chromosome abnormalities or takenany drugs. 
Intervention: 
All subjects were measured weight, height, hipcircumference, waist circumference, waist/hip circumference ratio and takenfamilial history of hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease and diabetesmellitus. 
The 12 hours fasting venous blood lipid and insulin level wasmeasured by enzyme colorimetry and immunometric assay. 
Results : Sixty-five obese children had hypercholesterolemia19%,hypertriglyceridemia 28%, High LDL 16% , Low HDL 3% andhyperinsulinemia26.2%. 
There are no relationship between hyperlipidemia andseverity of obesity, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist/hipcircumference ratio and familial history of hyperlipidemia, ischemic heartdisease, DM. 
There was a significant association between hyperinsulinemiawith degree of obesity (P-value 0.024) especially morbid obesity(oddratio=16 as compared to mild obesity)and with age more than 10 years butnot associated with hyperlipidemia or BMI. 
Conclusions: 
Obese children and adolescents had high prevalenceof hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia. 
There was a significant associationwith severity of obesity especially morbid obesity and age more than10 years.
