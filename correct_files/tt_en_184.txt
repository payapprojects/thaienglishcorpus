The purpose of this quasi experimental research is to determine the effects of EMG biofeedback and progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety, perceived self efficacy to control dyspnea, exercise tolerance and lung function in COPD patients. 
Thirty COPD patients from Central Chest Hospital were purposely selected for this study. 
The sample was divided equally into two groups by matching sex, age and fev.
The fifteen patients assigned as the experimental group were trained by the investigator in EMG biofeedback and progressive muscle relaxation twice a week for 4 weeks. 
The patients also practiced muscle relaxation by themselves every day. 
The control group received routine care. 
Results of the study indicate that after 4 weeks the experimental group had significantly decreased their anxiety and dyspnea. 
They increased their self efficacy to control dyspnea, exercise tolerance and lung function  respectively . 
The result of the study suggests that nurses should integrate EMG biofeedback and progressive muscle relaxation into nursing therapeutics which would improve dyspnea in COPD patients.
