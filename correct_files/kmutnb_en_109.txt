Pre-steaming Technique on Paddy Soaking Process to Improve Parboiling Production Time
The soaking operation in parboiling process was time consuming and predominantly controlled the parboiling process. 
In the present study, the soaking operation was improved to reduce time consumption of the parboiling process by pre-steaming the paddy prior to soaking. 
Chainat 1 paddy variety was used as a test material, having initial moisture at approximately 13.5–14% (db). 
The paddy was blown with saturated steam at 102°C for 2, 7, 17 and 32 min. 
Then, the paddy was soaked in 70°C water for 6 h. 
The initial moisture content of pre-steaming paddy was thus about 1.5 times higher than that of non-treatment. 
After soaking, paddy was shade dried at ambient temperature until its moisture content reached 14–16% (db). 
Head rice yield of soaked paddy from the process with pre-steaming was higher than that from the counterpart without pre-steaming. 
The head rice yield level of soaked paddy increased with an increase in soaking time. 
However, when the soaking time reached 5 and 6 h, head rice yield of the paddy, which underwent longer pre-steaming time for 17 and 32 min, decreased. 
In addition, pre-steaming before soaking caused whiteness index and white belly to decrease. 
The paddy undergoing 17 min pre-steaming with 3 h soaking and 32 min pre-steaming with 2 h soaking could maintain similar degree of gelatinization to the one undertaking only 4 h soaking.
