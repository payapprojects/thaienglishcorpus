ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio Pancreatography)
The procedure is used to assist the examination, diagnosis and treatment of bile and pancreatic duct abnormalities such as the obstruction at bile duct, pancreatic duct from gallstone and polyp.
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio Panereatography (ERCP) is a technique that combines the usage of X-ray together with the endoscope. 
The endoscope is inserted into the mouth and guided through the stomach into the small intestine and into the opening of the bile duct. 
A contrast media is injected into the duct for X-ray to examine abnormalities in the bile and pancreatic ducts. 
If gallstones are found in the bile duct, the opening may be enlarged to remove the stone by an elective wire. 
The cut at the opening will heal within a week.
