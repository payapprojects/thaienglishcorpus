In line with our transforming campus, we have also transformed our curriculum with almost 350 contemporary, flexible courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level, with practice-based learning and international opportunities built into every stage. 
Our 1,700 teaching staff come from industry, ensuring you benefit directly from their knowledge. 
We work with companies like Microsoft, Cisco and Jaguar Land Rover providing you with the chance to gain industry experience. 
If you want to work while you study our student employment agency ‘OpportUNIty’ will support with that. 
At the heart of it all is our student support system. 
‘Ask’, brings together student support within a single enquiry service covering a wide range of topics. 
In summary, Birmingham City University is a large, diverse and increasingly popular place to study. We put students at the heart of everything we do, giving them the best opportunities for future success.
