One of patientsâ€™ concerns before having gallstone surgery is how they can live normally without gallbladder. 
Consequently, today we have information provided by Dr.Sujin Sukhahuta, General Surgeon at Phyathai Nawamin Hospital to get this question clarified.
Where is "gallbladder" located in the body?
The location of the gallbladder is in the upper part of the abdominal cavity on the right side next to the bottom of the liver. 
The size of gallbladder is about 4 inches with pear-shaped appearance.
Function and Importance of Gallbladder
The gallbladder is responsible for keeping the bile produced by liver. 
It usually squeezes itself to release the bile to digest fat from food intake. 
Therefore, when we have food, the food then will be sent to the stomach. 
After that, the gallbladder will release the bile to break down fat from your meal.
What will happen after the gallbladder has been removed?
The doctor explained that the Gallbladder is just a part of the biliary system which acts as a bile reservoir. 
Actually, the source where the bile is produced is the liver which means the bile can still be digested after the gallbladder gets removed. 
According that, the body does not have to contain the bile at one spot then it goes straight to the stomach and intestine. 
Even though, the efficiency of fat digest might not good as before, in a while the body will be able to adjust and work normally.
