A Methodology to Determine the Number of Rolling Stock for Transportation Services and Preventive Maintenance
Since rolling stock which is the key equipment in a railway business is very expensive, it must be used the most efficiently. 
The objective of this paper is to determine the minimum number of the rolling stock that is sufficient for services in a given timetable and the preventive maintenance. 
A mathematical model was used to determine the minimum number of the rolling stock for a given timetable. 
As the results, at least 240 trains are needed for the future railway projects of Bangkok Metropolitan Region with the total service distance of 509 kilometers. 
It was found that the minimum number of the rolling stock depends on the service distance and headway of services in the peak hour period. 
Moreover, there may be some trains those are available from services during off-peak hour. 
A heuristic approach was used to schedule services and preventive maintenance tasks and determine the minimum number of the rolling stock for transportation services and preventive maintenance.
