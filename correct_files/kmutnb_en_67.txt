Effects of Functional Group and Surface Roughness on Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide in Porous Glass by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Sim
Adsorption of carbon dioxide in porous glass with different widths varying from 10-60 Ã… at 283 K are studied in this research using Monte Carlo simulation method. 
The molecular model of porous glass is assumed to be composed of SiO4 crystal and the atoms in it are laid in different planes. 
Two layers of crystal are parallel and perpendicular to the z-axis, the distance between these crystal layers is defined as the pore width (H). 
The porous glass surfaces are contained either functional groups or defects, it is found that the adsorption increases rapidly at low pressures and then it gradually increases with pressure. 
The functional groups show insignificant effect on adsorption isotherm, while an early onset in adsorption isotherm is observed in the case of surface roughness.
