Background : 
Urinary excretion of transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-(+,b)) are associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN).
Thiazolidinediones could reduce urinary protein excretion in patients withmicroalbuminuric DN. 
Objective: 
To evaluate the effect of pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione,on urinary TGF-(+,b) excretions in type 2 diabetic patients withmacroalbuminuria. 
Methods: 
Patients with type 2 diabetes with macroalbuminuria(albuminuria > 300 mg/d or proteinuria > 500 mg/d) were randomly assigned toreceive pioglitazone (30mg/d, n=14) or placebo (n=16), for 12 weeks. 
Results: 
Glycemic control and blood pressure in both groups were notsignificantly different. 
Urinary TGF-(+,b) excretion was decreased by 47.8% inthe pioglitazone group but was elevated by 59.7% in the placebo group (p=0.011).
Urinary protein excretion in the pioglitazone group was reduced from 1.64 to0.98 gram/day (g/d), or 40.1 % which was significantly different (p=0.016) fromthe 4.3% increase (from 1.72 to 1.80 g/d) in the placebo group. 
Conclusions: 
Besides the effectiveness in blood sugar control,pioglitazone could salutarily reduce urinary TGF-(+,b) excretion and proteinuriain type 2 diabetic patients with macroalbuminuria.
