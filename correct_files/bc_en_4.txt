KINGS COLLEGES
Kings was founded in 1957 in Bournemouth, and for over 60 years we have been at the forefront of quality education. 
Over the decades many thousands of students have benefitted from a Kings education. 
At Kings we encourage and enable each student to be the best they can be, and to set their ambitions as high as possible. 
This is why our students win places at every leading university in the UK. 
Kings Colleges students have been accepted by every UK Top 20 university, and this year saw the number of A* grades achieved being 75% above the national average. 
We now have 4 school locations - Bournemouth, Brighton, Oxford and London - all offering Pre-Sessional English, GCSEs, A-Levels, and the Advanced Level Foundation Programme, along with specialist courses including Medical School Preparation, Oxbridge Preparation, Art Foundation, and Law Foundation.
We take accommodation and welfare very seriously and students studying with us can choose to live in our student residences (single or shared suite rooms), or in host family accommodation. 
Our students succeed because we know what universities are looking for, we ensure very small classes (4-12 students per class), we guarantee highly qualified teachers, we achieve excellent results, we support every student, and we provide professional university guidance.
