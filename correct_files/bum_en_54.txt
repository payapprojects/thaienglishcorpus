EmbryoScope – View of an Embryo’s Development
Selecting the most suitable embryo for implantation provides the best chance of achieving a successful pregnancy. 
The latest technology developed to optimize successful IVF treatments involves the use of the EmbryoScope.
What is the EmbryoScope?
The EmbryoScope combines an incubator, a microscope, and a time-lapse camera to capture and record images to create a video record of the embryonic development. 
The developmental progress can be assessed without affecting the fertilised embryos.
Benefits of using the EmbryoScope
With the information obtained from the images taken by the time-lapse camera, scientists can assess and select the most appropriate or suitable embryo.
By monitoring the information and images provided by the system, scientists can track the sequence at which cell division is taking place with great precision.
Embryos are kept and developed in a more controlled environment with regard to temperature and pH.
Embryonic development is not affected due to reduced handling and manipulation of the embryos.
According to clinical studies, EmbryoScope provides the best chance of achieving a successful pregnancy and IVF treatment.
