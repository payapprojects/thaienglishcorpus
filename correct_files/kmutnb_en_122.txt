Biodiesel Production from Tung Oil and Its Effects on Diesel Engine Performance and Emission Characteristics
This paper presents the biodiesel production from Tung oil, prepared by transesterification using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst. 
Biodiesel properties was also investigated. 
Engine performance and emission tests were conducted on a single-cylinder diesel engine fueled with Tung oil biodiesel blends (BD10, BD20, BD30, BD50 and B100) compared with conventional diesel (B7) fuel at a full-load engine speed range of 1,200–2,000 rpm with intervals of 200 rpm. 
The Tung oil biodiesel contained the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) of 97.38% wt., viscosity of 7.46 cSt at 40°C, acid value of 0.41 mg KOH/g and a heating value of 42.53 MJ/kg. 
The experimental results showed that the increase of Tung oil biodiesel blend ratio decreased in torque, power and thermal efficiency (B100 showed average decrease 7.57%, 7.49% and 13.72%, respectively) but increased a specific fuel consumption (B100 showed an average increase 16.92%) compared to diesel. 
Exhaust gas emission results indicated that diesel blend of increasing Tung oil biodiesel gave a reduction in carbon monoxide (CO) but an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX). 
Sulphur dioxide (SO2) has not been detected all of fuel blends.
