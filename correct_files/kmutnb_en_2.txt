Influence of Carrageenan Addition on Physico-chemical and Sensory Properties of Low Fat Chicken Sausages
The objective of this study was to enhance the quality characteristics of low-fat chicken sausages by the incorporation of carrageenan at different levels (0, 1, 1.5 and 2% w/w). 
The physicochemical qualities, sensory evaluation and texture profile properties of low-fat chicken sausages were studied. 
The results showed that increasing carrageenan to product samples improved moisture content, water holding capacity along with cooking yield but decreased cooking loss (p < 0.05). 
This is probably due to the fact that they can form gel by themselves which entrapped more water and enhanced protein gel strength. 
For the color analysis, the addition of carrageenan increased a* (p < 0.05) and b* values but decreased L* value of the sausages by comparison with the corresponding control counterpart. 
In regard to the texture profile analysis, increasing carrageenan increased hardness and chewiness and decreased cohesiveness and gumminess; nonetheless the practice did not affect the sample springiness (p < 0.05). 
Analysis of protein and ash contents of low fat chicken sausage added with carrageenan at different levels showed no significant differences as compared to the control; while fat contents significantly decreased with increasing amounts of carrageenan addition. 
Sensory evaluation revealed that the low-fat chicken sausages containing 1.5% and 2% carrageenan had no significantly higher scores for flavor, texture and overall acceptability than the control counterpart (P > 0.05).
