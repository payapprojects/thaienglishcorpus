Confidence Intervals for the Difference between Two Proportions by Sampling Importance Resampling Algorithm
Confidence intervals for the difference between two proportions (p1 – p2) have gained interest by statisticians from the past to present. 
Several researchers have proposed and compared this type of confidence intervals. 
Nowadays, computers play an important role in computational statistics. 
Methods of confidence interval constructions could employ algorithms instead of direct analytical method. 
In this research, Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) algorithm frequently found in Bayesian statistics is applied to construct the confidence intervals which are then compared to those obtained from Bayes, hybrid, and Wald confidence intervals. 
The results show that confidence intervals obtained from SIR give the coverage probabilities not different from those of Bayes and hybrid methods, and theses 3 methods are superior to the Wald method in all population characteristics and sample sizes. 
Because SIR algorithm directly used samples of p1 and p2, confidence intervals of p1 – p2 are definitely in [–1, +1]. 
In case of , SIR algorithm can still construct a confidence interval while the Wald interval cannot be calculated as the standard error is of zero. 
The characteristic of population affects length of intervals such that if p1 and p2 are closed to .5 (symmetric), interval length tends to be greater than that calculated from skewed population such as p1 = p2 = .05. 
To conclude, in many situations SIR algorithm can produce as good a confidence interval as Bayes and hybrid method, one of the most efficient methods in literature review.
