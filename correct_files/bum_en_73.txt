New Robotic Gait Training Technology Speeds Rehabilitation
Bumrungrad now uses this advanced technology to restore quality of life sooner for patients with neurological disorders.
Neurological disorders, such as a stroke, Parkinson’s disease and brain injury, as well as weakened leg muscles, are all conditions which prevent patients from being able to walk normally. 
Effective rehabilitation involves performing the same movements repeatedly and continuously over an extended period. 
Under the guidance of rehabilitation medicine specialists and physical therapists, Bumrungrad Hospital provides a Robotic Gait Training System to support patients going through this rehabilitation process. 
Employing the latest advances in technology, the system helps patients to walk near normally and restore their quality of life in a shorter period than can be achieved through traditional rehabilitation therapy.
About Robotic Gait Training
Robotic Gait Training is the latest medical innovation used to enhance the effectiveness of ambulation training in patients with neurological disorders and weakened muscles. 
The main features of the robotic gait system are: 
Adjustable body weight support enabling patients to train in an active and more natural way 
A variety of computer-assisted gait training programs including regular stepping, weight bearing, walking on flat ground, and climbing up and down stairs, with the appropriate training program chosen for each patient
Motion range displayed in real time enabling physicians and rehabilitation specialists to develop a proper rehabilitation plan for each patient   
Advantages of Robotic Gait Training
Facilitates a gradual increase in the duration of the training and encourages the brain cells to learn from the repetitive training enabling the patients to achieve their walking goals from a shorter training period
Enables patients to train in a variety of programs, including stepping, weight bearing, walking on flat ground, and climbing up and down stairs
Reduces muscle soreness or fatigue caused by excessive exercises or making inappropriate movements
Offers an adjustable training program and speed for each patient
Enables patients to regain muscle strength and walk over a longer distance
Reduces the body weight support for both patients and therapists during training
Enables patients to walk near normally and restore their quality of life in a shorter period than can be achieved with traditional rehabilitation methods
Patients who are suitable for robotic gait training
Patients who are suitable for robotic gait training include patients with neurological disorders and weakened leg muscles which result in an inability to walk normally and maintain balance. 
Relevant neurological disorders include:
Stroke
Parkinson’s disease
Spinal cord injuries
Brain injuries or accidents
Before being approved for robotic gait training, a patient must first be evaluated by a doctor.
