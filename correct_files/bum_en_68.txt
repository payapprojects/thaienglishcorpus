Botulinum Toxin Injections for the Treatment of Neurological and Movement Disorders
Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is a protein and neurotoxin which is extremely effective in treating certain neurological and movement disorders. 
BoNT injections are used to treat disabling pain, varieties of dystonia, abnormal movement disorders and autonomic nervous system.

Symptoms of neurological conditions
Pain
Chronic daily headaches, including chronic migraine headache or chronic tension headache
Myofascial (tissues covering and connecting muscles), neck or back pain
Movement disorders
Blepharospasm (eyelid twitches)
Hemifacial spasm (twitches on one half of the face)
Oromandibular dystonia (contractions of the mouth, jaw and tongue muscles)
Cervical dystonia (contractions of the neck muscles)
Truncal dystonia (contractions of the torso muscles)
Hand or foot dystonia
Refractory tremor (persistent and uncontrollable shaking) 
Palatal tremor (shaking of the rear roof of the mouth)
Tics, Myoclonus (brief, involuntary twitching of the muscles)
Spasticity (stiff or rigid muscles)
Bruxism (teeth grinding)
Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating, especially of the armpits, palms and soles) 
Hypersalivation or Sialorrhea (excessive production of saliva)
How BoNT works
BoNT works by blocking unwanted transmissions from being sent along the nervous system by preventing an organic compound called acetylcholine from being released. 
This reduces the volume of transmissions passing the point where the nervous system connects with the muscle system connect and reaching the bodyâ€™s pain receptors and involuntary nervous system.
Risk Factors
Pregnancy: Studies on animals show adverse effects on the fetus but no controlled tests have been conducted on humans.
Lactation: Safety unknown due to insufficient data
Drug interaction: Can cause negative reactions if taken at the same time as some antibiotics ( aminoglycosides), malaria medication (Chloroquine), and neuromuscular blocking agents
Neuromuscular disorders: Can cause a muscle weakening condition known as myasthenia gravis
Common side effects from:
Facial injection to treat hemifacial spasm, eyelid twitching, chronic daily headache, facial tics, teeth grinding, or hypersalivation
Bruising 
Drooping eyelid 
Blurred vision, double vision 
Facial weakness
Dry mouth
Neck injection to treat neck muscle contractions or neck pain
Pain at the point of injection
Local muscle weakness
Difficulty swallowing
Dry mouth, hoarse voice 
Limb and body injection to treat muscle contractions, twitching, or shaking
Local muscle weakness 
General usage
The toxin may spread beyond the injected area, causing difficulty with swallowing or breathing. 
The risks increase when BoNT is injected into children, used in high doses or injected into the wrong muscles.
Recommendation
Always consult a specialist before receiving this treatment
Report any side effects to your doctor immediately
