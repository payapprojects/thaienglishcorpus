This research proposed to study milk fouling in the flow channels of shell and tube heat exchangers used in the raw milk preheating process. 
The study considered the formation of fouling by probing the changes in the pressure drop across a 2-meter long milk fouling test unit. 
The effect of flow rates (4,000 l/h, 9,000 l/h and 12,000 l/h) was studied at a controlled hot water temperature (80°C) at a fixed experimental period of 2 hours. 
It was found that, at higher flow rate, the pressure drop was lower with thinner calculated scale layer thickness ranging from 1.42 cm to 0.53 cm and 0.17 cm, respectively. 
This might be because the protein ß-Lactoglobulin could not attach and spread out easily on the heat exchanger surface at high flow rates. 
As a result, the efficiency of the heat exchanger was increased, leading to lower energy consumption and longer production time. 
In addition, this research proposed to use a theoretical model to link between the calculated scale layer thickness and the reduction of heat transfer. 
This model was proved by comparing with the actual plant operation to work well and could be used for the economic evaluation of the process. 
It was found that by increasing the flow rate from 9,000 l/h to 12,000 l/h, the cleaning cycle could be delayed from every 8 h to every 17 h, leading to significant saving in the dairy industry.
