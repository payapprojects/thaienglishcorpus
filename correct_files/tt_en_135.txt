Background : 
Some diabetic patients have defects in T lymphocytefunction and phagocytic activity of macrophages that can affectimmunogenicity after vaccination. 
Immunological response after vaccinationin diabetic patients have been inconclusive, partly due to inability toexclude the natural immunity factor for example studies on influenza andpneumococcal vaccines. 
Rabies is a life-threatening disease but can beprevented by vaccination which is highly effective. 
Rabies vaccination isquite common in Thailand (up to 240,000 patients/year). 
We studiedpre-exposure rabies vaccination in diabetic patients to determine theeffectiveness of rabies vaccine in preventioning this common andlife-threatening disease. 
Objective : 
To study the response of pre-exposure rabiesintramuscular vaccination in diabetic patients. 
Design : 
Descriptive study. 
Subjects and Method : 
Thirty-three type 2 diabetic patients whovisited Chulalongkorn diabetic clinic were enrolled. 
All patients receivedthree doses of 0.5 ml purified vero rabies vaccine intramuscularly on day0, 7 and 28. Rabies neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers were determined bythe rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test on day 0 and 42. 
Results : 
All patients developed protective antibody concentration(Nab > 0.5 IU/ml) against rabies on day 42.(Response rate 100%) Thegeometric mean of Nab titers are 20.82 IU/ml (range 2.049-2.54). 
Nocorrelation between levels of antibody and any patient characteristics e.g.duration of diabetes, glycemic control or diabetic complications. 
Noserious adverse effects or systemic reactions were reported. 
Conclusion : 
All Diabetic patients have protective immunologicalresponse after intramuscular pre-exposure rabies vaccine at day 42 postimmunization.
