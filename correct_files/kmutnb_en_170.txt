Determination of Filament Winding Path on a Composite Elbow Pipe for the Automatic Winding Machine
Composite pipes have an important role in construction industry in terms of strength, corrosion resistance, lightweight and non-rust. 
To manufacture composite pipes, glass fiber is dipped into resin solution and wound around a mandrel pipe. 
This research determines the elbow pipe filament winding path on an elbow mandrel by using helix curve equations. 
A CAD/CAM software determines the number of winding rounds to obtain the desired filament angle, and simulates the filament winding pattern. 
The experiments show that the filament winding machine is able to automatically wind the filament similar to the design pattern. 
The validation is done by comparing the machine winding path with the simulation winding path on an elbow pipe. 
The result shows that the machine works according to the design. 
This study provides the knowledge on determination of the filament winding path on elbow pipes for the automatic winding machine. 
The results can be applied to various sizes of elbow pipes.
