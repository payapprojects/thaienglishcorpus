OS X Legacy FileVault - "There isn't enough space on your hard disk..." alert
When turning Legacy FileVault on or off in Security & Privacy preferences, you may see an alert if you are low on disk space: "There isn&apost enough space on your hard disk to turn on &lparor off&rpar FileVault."
Create a new user account and transfer your data to the account via a sparse disk image. 
If you&aposre using OS X Snow Leopard or earlier, you can then re-enable Legacy FileVault on the new account or leave it off if desired. 
When you&aposre done, you can delete your original account to recover disk space.
Important: Before performing these steps, you should back up your data &lparor your entire home folder&rpar as a precaution.
