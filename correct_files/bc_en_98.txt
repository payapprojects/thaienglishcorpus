Tettenhall College
Our mission at Tettenhall College is to ensure that every pupil achieves their personal best by providing an education that develops the whole person both in and beyond the classroom. 
We are proud to be able to offer a truly global perspective with exceptional extra-curricular opportunities that complement rigorous academic standards. 
Tettenhall College offers a unique opportunity for your child's education in the UK; set in a picturesque small village setting yet with excellent transport links to nearby cosmopolitan cities and international airports including London which is under 2 hours away. 
Our boarders thrive in a safe, secure and happy family environment, where lifelong friendships are made in the pursuit of academic excellence.
We place emphasis on developing individual strengths of all abilities within a nurturing environment of small class sizes and excellent pastoral care. 
A Foundation Year is available for international pupils wanting to study A levels in 3 years with additional English Language to support and enhance their English language skills.
Outside of the classroom, there are extensive opportunities for extra-curricular activities in the arts, music, drama, sport and charity work. 
There are excellent on-site facilities including a swimming pool, a theatre, music practice rooms and over 30 acres of grounds to explore, whilst the village and local shops are just on the doorstep. 
Boarders enjoy a wide range of enriching weekend activities and cultural visits and staff are always there to share our pupils' successes and help them with any problems. 
Our boarders are extremely happy here and are a valued part of our school community as recognised by recent inspection reports. 
Our pupils consistently achieve beyond expectations, leaving as well-rounded, confident young adults ready to face the challenges ahead.
