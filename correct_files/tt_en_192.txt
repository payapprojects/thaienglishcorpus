The objective of this research was to assess the effectiveness of health education program for blood sugar level control by applying Self -Efficacy Theory and Health Belief Model with group activities. 
The study sample was non - insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients who attended Sakolnakorn Hospital during October 1997 to March 1998 by dever randomly selected into the experimental group and the comparison group. 
The experimental group comprised 48 patients while the comparison group was 50. 
The experimental group received the health education program by group activities 3 times at 1 month intervals while the comparison group received the regular health education program. 
The data was collected by interview questionaires and record forms. 
Frequencies, percentages, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, students t-test, paired sample t-test were applied to analyse the data. 
The results of this study show that the experimental group gained a statistically higher level of knowledge and practice about Diabetes, the perceived susceptibility and severity to complication, the Self- Efficacy, the practice response efficacy and the practiceness than before experimentation and more than those of the comparison group. 
In addition, in the experimental group, the fasting blood sugar was decreased at the end of the program and rated significantly lower than those in the comparison group. 
Regarding these findings, it is recommended that the health education program leading to improved blood sugar level should be implemented. 
The program should be appied to other chronic disease patients.
