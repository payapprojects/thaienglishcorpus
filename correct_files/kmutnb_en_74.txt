Mince of Julian’s golden carp was used as raw material in producing surimi with the washing cycles of 1, 2 and 3 times at the weight ratio of mince fish to water at 1:4. 
Then, the washed mince fish was analyzed for its chemical composition compared with that of unwashed one. 
The results revealed that washing resulted in protein increasing from 88.26 to 97.30%, but the number of washing cycles showed no significant difference in protein content (p≥0.05). 
However, the pH increased significantly with the higher number of washing cycles (p<0.05) while fat and ash content tended to be lower. 
Surimi gel was prepared by chopping surimi and mixed with 3% salt to obtain sol. 
The sol was then, incubated in warm water at 40 deg Celsius for 30 minutes prior to heating in hot water at 90 deg Celsius for 30 minutes. 
The result showed that surimi gel had higher breaking force, deformation, and whiteness than that of normal mince fish gel. 
Moreover, higher number of washing cycles yielded more whiteness (p<0.05) and higher deformation. 
However, the higher number of washing cycles had no effect on breaking force and expressible drip (p≥0.05). 
Nevertheless, the strength of surimi gel treated with different washing cycles was higher than that of the Thai Industrial Standard value of frozen mince fish (not less than 400 gm.cm) with the range between 1,017.35 and 1,175.30 gm.cm indicating that the produced surimi from Julian’s golden carp reached the standard quality which can be improved washing cycles. 
However, 2 and 3 washing cycles resulted in no difference on breaking force, deformation, and expressible drip. 
It can be concluded that 3 washing cycles yielded more whiteness, thus, was the most suitable treatment to gain Julian’s golden carp surimi with better quality.
