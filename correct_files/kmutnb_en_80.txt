Energy Absorption and Failure Patterns of Multilayer Bulletproof Concrete Panel Made of Steel Fiber, Styrofoam and Para-rubber
This study presents the preliminary test results from the multilayer bulletproof concrete panel project. 
The tested multilayer panel consisted of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC), Para-rubber and Styrofoam sheet. 
In this study, the focus was on the investigation of the failure patterns and energy absorption of each material with different thickness subjected to direct fire arm with 9 mm bullets. 
The obtained information will later be used in designing the multilayer bulletproof concrete panel based on combination of energy absorption. 
The results showed that the energy absorption of each material increased with the increasing thickness. 
In case of SFRC, the energy absorption also depended on fiber type and volume fractions. 
Comparing at the same thickness, SFRC was the most effective energy absorption followed by Para-rubber and Styrofoam sheet respectively.
