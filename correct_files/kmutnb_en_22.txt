The Increment of Biodiesel B100 Usage Potential in Thailand's Coastal Fishery Boats
In 2013, Thailand’s energy conservation promotion fund (ENCON Fund) worked on “The Pilot Project of Biodiesel B20 for Coastal Fishery Boat”, which was one of the driven forces on Thailand’s Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP). 
The result confirmed an engineering feasibility and the analytical results of Thailand’s biodiesel usage found that biodiesel usage was higher than expected in annual AEDP year 2015. 
However, biodiesel usage needs to be promoted continuously. 
This research analyzed the potential of biodiesel B100 usage and the decrease of imported conventional diesel which were caused by Coastal Fishery Boats. 
It is found that the coastal fishery boat and small fishery boat can increase the potential of biodiesel B100 usage by 4.45 and 18.13 liters per day, respectively, which equal 82.52 and 506.98 bahts per day. 
Therefore, if all fishery boats change to biodiesel B20, the biodiesel B100 usage will be increased 313,053.54 liters per day and the biodiesel B100 imported value will be decreased 8.05 million bahts per day. 
This shows positive impacts on Thailand’s economics, society and environment.
