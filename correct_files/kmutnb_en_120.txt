The main purpose of this study is efficiency of flood mitigation in Bang Prakong- Prachin Buri River Basin with Huay Sa-Mong Dam and Klong Pra Sathueng Reservoir projects employing Mathematical Models. 
The Info Work ICM model was developed and calibrated for flood study in 2005, 2006 and 2013. 
The scenarios for this study are existing river system and including these reservoirs in river system. 
The results, discharges, were compared at 3 gauging stations; KGT.3, KGT.6 and KGT.1. 
As the result, the discharges at KGT.3 were decrease by 26.97, 54.31 and 37.36 m3/s in 2005, 2006 and 2013, respectively or equal to 4.88%, 9.59% and 5.12%. 
The discharges at KGT.6 also decreased by 24.62, 30.80 and 60.89 m3/s in 2005, 2006 and 2013, respectively or equal to 4.30%, 4.94% and 6.79%. 
For the last station, KGT.1, the discharges decreased by 25.27, 38.21 and 19.60 m3/s in 2005, 2006 and 2013, respectively or equal to 3.62%, 5.42%.and 2.96%. 
In conclusions, the study described that Huay Sa-Mong Dam and Klong Pra Sathueng Reservoirs revealed effectiveness of flood damage mitigation. 
However, the measure effectiveness still depends on the characteristics and distribution of rainfall in the basin. 
Thus, appropriate measures focusing on flood mitigation and preparedness should also be taken into account.
