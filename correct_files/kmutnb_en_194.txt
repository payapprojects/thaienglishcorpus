Model of Intelligent Cloud Learning System to Develop Digital Literacy and Collaborative Learning Skills
Intelligent cloud learning system is a learning tool which is used to adaptive suitable contents and tests for individual learnersâ€™ and group activities. 
The purposes of this research comprise: 1) to design intelligent cloud learning system to develop digital literacy and collaborative learning skills; and 2) to evaluate the appropriateness of the model of intelligent cloud learning system to develop digital literacy and collaborative learning skills Questionnaires were used to evaluate the appropriateness of the model on the components of intelligent cloud learning system from seven experts who have experiences in designing learning model and education technology. 
From the results, it can be concluded that the overall appropriateness of the model of intelligent cloud learning system to develop digital literacy and collaborative skills reaches the mean score of 4.48 (S.D. is 0.51) with very high level of the appropriateness.
