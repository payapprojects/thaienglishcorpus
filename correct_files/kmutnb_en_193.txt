Management of a Multi-robots System for Industrial Material Handling
Recently, material handling of manufacturing factories tends to widely adopt AGV robots. 
However, AGV robots mostly handle one-by-one material from a start station to a final station, repeatedly. 
This research introduces a multi-robots material handling system that can handle multiple robots and stations at the same time. 
The control program is based on ROS (Robot Operating System). 
The objective of this research is to improve the effectiveness of material handling system by adding more flexibility and reducing the robot work time. 
The management system uses the market-based approach combined with Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for material handling in a manufacture factory. 
The simulation results found that the system is able to control various types of AGV robots. 
This means that the system has ability to order and execute the best robot among all working robots in the system for an incoming task at the current situation. 
This reduces the total working time by a half comparing with FIFO method. 
In the case study of the 65-m2 working area, the optimum number of the robots is 3 to execute 100 tasks. 
The research results shown that the system can arrange materials handling by choosing the suitable robots for overall fastest cycle time. 
This system increases flexibility in handling materials in various working spaces. 
The knowledge of this research can be applied on many factories, which use multiple robots for various tasks to hand materials from start stations to final stations.
