This research considers all the existing laws relating totelecommunications in Thailand. 
A main purpose of this researchis to evalulate whether they can cope with value added servicesin Thailand and whether or not and how such laws should beimproved or amended so that they could keep up with social,economic and technological advancement. 
The research finds that the provisions of suchtelecommunication laws presently governing and dealing with valueadded services in Thailand are unclear and ambiguous. 
As a resultthere have so far been many problems derived from the enforcementand interpretation of the laws, which have more or less affectedoperations of various agencies or organizations providing suchvalue added servies. 
Moreover, as the laws do not correspond withnational policy on provisions of public utility and as no efforthave been made to improve or amend the laws to keep up withdevelopment of telecommunication technology, there arelimitations which hinder promotion and development of the valueadded services especially the laws emphasizing control by astate. 
To improve and amend such laws so that they accord with thesocial economic and technological development of Thailand, it isproposed that certain measures should be undertaken to promoteand encourage private sectors participation.
