Behaviour of Structural Composite Hybrid Panels Under Combined Bending and Axial Compression Loads
This research deals with performance studies of load bearing hybrid composite walls under combined bending and axial compression loads developed at Rajamangala University of Technology Tawan-Ok. 
The hybrid composite wall consists of fiber cement board as a sandwich-board and light-weight foamed concrete mixed with Expandable Polystyrene foam (EPS) in waffle-arrangement as a core material. 
The testing programme includes sixteen structural composite panels and were tested under a combination of axial compression and flexural bending loads. 
Tested specimens were divided into two types; type A - without a steel skeleton and type B - with a cold-form C75×45 skeleton placed in the middle of the panel. 
Based on the test results, it was found that deflections of panels type A were higher than that of specimen type B due to the presence of a steel skeleton. 
The maximum failure loads of panel specimen type B exhibited higher loads than that of specimen type A. 
This is because the presence of cold-form steel in specimen type B caused a higher stiffness and thus a higher load bearing capacity. 
Moreover, it is also found that the serviceability loads of panel type A and type B are 1.22 kN and 2.04 kN, respectively. 
Based on the analysis of the test results, the P-M interaction diagram can be obtained by considering the reduction factor for the design procedure. 
For conservative design, the reduction factor (ϕ) = 0.3 is recommended by comparing the ratio between serviceability load and load at failure which are 31.2% and 36.7% for specimens type A and type B, respectively.
