Development of MATLAB GUI for Induction Motor Fault Diagnosis
This paper presents a software development for stator and rotor fault diagnoses in induction motors based on the MATLAB GUI. 
The concept of the detection is to detect the fault spectra caused by the failures of the stator and rotor. 
The important analytical technique is the Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA). 
Two intelligent methods including an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) are selected to carry out fault classification and diagnosis. 
The software starts to analyze when users enter the important information i.e. 
the motor stator current in the time domain. 
Subsequently, the software will analyze and show the results in the window of the MATLAB GUI, which is easy to read the results and to plan the maintenance. 
In addition, the fault classification performances are satisfactory with more than 85% accuracy.
