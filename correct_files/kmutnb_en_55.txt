The objectives of this study were to determine the 10-micron particulate matter (PM10) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) levels in indoor air at a religious site in Thailand. 
The 36 samples were collected at different sampling points; near the pollutant source (incense burner) and four meters from the pollutant source using a Deployable Particulate Sampler. 
The relationships among the meteorological data, wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and PM10 and PAHs levels were also determined. 
The results showed that the PM10 mean levels were 677.83–719.83 μg/m3, the PAHs mean levels were 4.07–5.38 ng/m3, and the PM10 and PAHs levels at different sampling points were not significantly different. 
The relationship results showed that temperature was negatively related with the PM10 at 95% confidence interval, but the wind speed and relative humidity were not shown to be significantly related with the PM10 and PAHs levels.
