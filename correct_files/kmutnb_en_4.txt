Extracting Silica from Biomass Fly Ash by Using Alkaline Hydrothermal Treatment and Silica Precipitation by Using Organic Acids
This study aims to investigate the optimal condition to extract and precipitate silica from biomass fly ash. 
Results showed that the best condition to extract silica from fly ash in this study was by treating fly ash with 3M NaOH solution using fly ash-to-solution ratio of 1 : 10 g/ml at 90oC for 24 h. 
The findings indicate that these studied variables are of importance to the dissolution of silica from biomass fly ash. 
In the study on precipitating silica using organic acid solution, results showed that the use of citric acid and precipitation condition at pH of 4 were the appropriate conditions by giving the maximum silica precipitation (98.5%). 
This was because of sufficient acidic conditions to precipitate silica and the appropriate dissociation constant of organic acid. 
The obtained silica was analyzed by using X-ray diffraction was amorphous silica. 
X-ray fluorescence analysis showed that the obtained product was mainly composed of silica at 95.6%. 
Therefore, the use of biomass fly ash as a raw material for silica production is an interesting way to enhance value for biomass fly ash.
