Diabetes mellitus is a non-communicable disease that is an important public health problem in many countries. 
Diabetic patients, who have no self-control in food consumption, physical exercise and use of medication may have complications. 
This study was a quasi-experimental research with the main objective to assess the effectiveness of a health education program for blood glucose control of type 2 diabetic patients. 
The research applied Self-control and Self-efficacy based on Social Cognitive Theory. 
The sample of the study consisted of 38 diabetic patients in the experimental group and 35 diabetic patients in the comparison group. 
Four sessions of the health education program were organized over a period of three months. 
The activities of the program were group discussions, brain storming, sharing diabetic knowledge, situation analysis, providing models, practicing skills in choosing menus and physical exercise, planning and recording in a logbook, and providing information by letter three times. 
Data were collected before and after the experiment by interviews. 
The statistical analysis was done using percentage, Independent t-test, Paired t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon Signs Ranks Test and Repeated Measurement One way ANOVA. 
Results showed that after implementing the program, the experimental group had a significant increase in knowledge about diabetes mellitus, self-efficacy in dietary control, physical exercise, and taking medication and in the self-control process of identifying opportunities for self-monitoring, goal setting, problem solving, and self-reward. 
In addition, after the experiment, the experimental group had a statistically decreased HbA(,lc) and capillary blood glucose levels than before the experiment. 
The findings from this study indicated that a health education program could positively improve knowledge, self-efficacy and self-control. 
Therefore, this program should be applied to diabetic patients in other hospitals.
