Located in Southsea, Hampshire St John’s College is a Christian independent day and boarding school for girls and boys aged 2 – 18 years. 
We are a wide-range ability school offering a rounded education and providing opportunities for pupils through an extensive range of activities to develop talents and create confident young people for the future. 
Our quest for academic excellence is paramount, but our aim is that everyone should fulfil their potential, whatever that may be. 
The College was founded in 1908 by a community established by John Baptist De La Salle, the patron saint of teachers. 
In September 2015 we became independent from the De La Salle Trust but we remain a Lasallian school and continue to follow our Founder's vision in both our academic and pastoral care. 
The main College campus is located in Southsea - a small seaside town in the historical city of Portsmouth, which is the UK’s only island city. 
Our Nursery, Junior School, Senior School, Sixth Form College and Boarding School are all situated on the one 6-acre campus, and we own extensive Playing Fields on the outskirts of the city.
