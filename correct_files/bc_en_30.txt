Established 50 years ago, the University of Essex has gained a global reputation for pioneering research which helps change lives. 
We provide a research-led education which equips our students with the curiosity and capability for personal and professional success.
We’re a university where curiosity prevails, and where exploring new ways of thinking and pushing boundaries, isn’t just encouraged, it’s expected. 
We were named University of the Year at the Times Higher Education Awards 2018. 
We’re proud to be Gold rated in the Teaching Excellence Framework 2017 and ranked in the top 30 in The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide. 
We're also in the top 25 for research quality in the Good University Guide and top 15 for the sixth year running in The National Student Survey for overall student satisfaction (2018, overall student satisfaction, English mainstream universities*).
We're committed to two things: excellence in teaching and excellence in research. 
We put student success at the heart of our mission, supporting every student from every background to achieve outstanding outcomes; preparing our students to thrive in their future lives. 
We are also ideally located - less than one hour from London, the UK’s most exciting city, but with a much lower cost of living, and it has become the choice of many Thai students when studying in the UK.
