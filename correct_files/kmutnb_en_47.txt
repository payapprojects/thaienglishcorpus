Automation System Assisting Commencement Ceremony Rehearsal
This paper presents an automation system that assists rehearsals for the commencement ceremony. 
As individual representatives' fatigue solutions from long rehearsal hours, a working robot arm is used for delivering certificates in replacement of manual procedures. 
The system is required to completely perform its respective duties as to get prepared for any disruptions during rehearsals. 
The developed automation system consists of a robot arm, a certificate dispenser machine, and a hand detector, all of which must perform correspondingly. 
The system is designed to be automatic and is controlled by a microcontroller, making it cheap, light weight, with fast-reacting robotic limbs Robotic mechanical functions must conform to the graduates' grasping motions. 
According to the running test, the robotic arm can carry out certificate delivery with precision. 
Furthermore, the mechanical limb is supposed to wait by itself during individual pickup before executing its further cycle.
