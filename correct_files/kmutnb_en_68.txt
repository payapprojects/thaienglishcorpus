Study for Adsorption of Gas Mixture in Activated Carbon by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation
Adsorption isotherm and adsorption selectivity of carbon dioxide-methane mixture in slit-shaped pore model are investigated in this study. 
The simulation has been carried out by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation (GCMC) method. 
The adsorption isotherm of gas mixture in different pore widths is studied at various temperatures from 293.15 to 318.15 K. 
We also vary the mole fraction of gas mixture. 
It is found that the adsorption and selectivity increase with total pressure, while they decrease when the temperature increases. 
The adsorption also decreases when the pore width increases. 
When the mole fraction of carbon dioxide in gas mixture increases, the adsorption increases while the selectivity decreases significantly.
