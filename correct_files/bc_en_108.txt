Our history
The British Council is the UK’s international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities. 
We create friendly knowledge and understanding between the people of the UK and other countries. 
Using the UK’s cultural resources we make a positive contribution to the countries we work with – changing lives by creating opportunities, building connections and engendering trust.
We work with over 100 countries across the world in the fields of arts and culture, English language, education and civil society. 
Each year we reach over 20 million people face-to-face and more than 500 million people online, via broadcasts and publications.
Founded in 1934, we are a UK charity governed by Royal Charter and a UK public body. 
The majority of our income is raised delivering a range of projects and contracts in English teaching and examinations, education and development contracts and from partnerships with public and private organisations. 
Eighteen per cent of our funding is received from the UK government.
