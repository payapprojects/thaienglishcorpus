Extraction and Characterization of Residual Oil from Spent Bleaching Earth
Spent Bleaching Earth (SBE) is an industrial waste of edible vegetable oil production generated from bleaching process of crude oil. 
As spent bleaching earth contains between 20â€“40% oil by weight, its disposal by landfill or incineration may cause the dangers of fire and pollution. 
In addition, the combustion of residual oil in spent bleaching earth leads to the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
Extraction of residual oil from spent bleaching earth before disposal thus becomes a promising approach and issue of interest to eliminate these problems.
From previous research, solvent extraction is the most popular method for extraction of the residual oil. 
This paper therefore reviews factors that affect the extraction efficiency and properties of extracted oil. 
The information contained in this review would serve as a guideline with the greatest capacity for the mentioned procedure.
