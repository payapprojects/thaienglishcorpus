Effects of Electrolytes on Zinc Deposition onto a Nickel Foam
The electrodeposition of zinc on nickel foam was prepared to use as an anode. 
The effects of potassium hydroxide (KOH) or zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) on the deposition of Zn dendrite at different current density were investigated. 
The morphology characterization of Zn dendrite was performed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). 
The Zn anode prepared at the current density of 0.8A and using ZnSO4 as electrolyte showed a good morphology called compact. 
It gave a specific discharge of 210 cycles for more than 5 hours.
