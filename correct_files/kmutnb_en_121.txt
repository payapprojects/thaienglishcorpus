Evaluation of Groundwater Requirement of Groundwater Development Project for Agriculture: A Case Study of Nong Boon Mak District, Na
To provide adequate amount of irrigation water, as a supplement to rain water for abundant is a key factor to increase crop yield. 
Therefore, evaluation of the water resources potential, in particular water from the underground sources appears to be the key first step to improve the overall crop production. 
This study was conducted in 2 villages in Nong Boon Mak District, Nakhon Ratchasima Province. 
The chosen villages are Baan Daan Kor Jod and Baan Saeng Thong. 
Crop water requirement of the former group of farmers is for cassavagrowing areas (106 rai); where as the latter group needs water for the areas of cassava (46 rai) and corn as livestock feed (14 rai). 
Groundwater yield capacity was estimated by different methods including groundwater yield map, hydrological survey using resistivity method and pumping test. 
It was found that groundwater capacity is 14 and 16 m3/hr at Baan Daan Kor Jod and Baan Saeng Thong. 
The comparison results of the water requirements and groundwater supply capacity based on water balance concept confirm the feasibility of groundwater-based irrigation development project. 
In cope with interannual variability of rainfall and insufficient groundwater storage, production planning can be adjusted by shifting planting schedule or reducing growing area.
