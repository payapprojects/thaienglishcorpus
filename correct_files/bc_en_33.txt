WOODHOUSE GROVE SCHOOL
Founded in 1812 and situated on a beautiful 70 acre campus, Woodhouse Grove provides a first class all round education for boys and girls. 
Conveniently located close to major air, railway and motorway networks, the 750 pupils at Woodhouse Grove (11-18) benefit from small class sizes, first class facilities, and a breadth of opportunity that readily allow us to fulfil the school's stated aims. 
We are also proud that each year our pupils accepted places at Oxford and Cambridge along with numerous Russell group universities.
Our boarders enjoy modern, well equipped boarding houses, a secure and caring environment, a 'home from home' atmosphere, and an ever changing range of weeknight and weekend activities which contribute to the enjoyment of being a boarder at the Grove.
Academically ambitious and academically sensitive, the progress of each pupil is monitored by heads of year in school and by a houseparent with academic house tutors in the boarding house where regular meetings take place to support, advise and encourage. 
Our international students are drawn from all over the world and are mentored by English boarding and day pupils to help them integrate and encourage wider use of the English language.
We are a school where traditional values are central to our warm and friendly community. 
Wherever a child's ability lies, we will seek to nurture and encourage its development on their route to becoming a "Grovian".
