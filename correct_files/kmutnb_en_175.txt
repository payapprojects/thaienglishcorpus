Cause of Delay in the Construction Project by Relative Importance Index Method
The research aims to provide information for successful construction project management. 
There are a large number of variables that can affect project delays and disruptions. 
Previously the investigation focused on project overview while excluding project stakeholders. 
In other words, ongoing construction were not taken into consideration. 
In this study, the analysis was done in terms of overall and separate considerations on causality; thus stakeholders attitude towards the project can be separated. 
The causal group encompasses the owner group, designer and supervisor group, along with the contractor group. 
The data were gathered from representative engineers associated with the construction projects in Bangkok and its vicinity. 
Factors causing delays and disruptions were analyzed using Relative Importance Index (RII). 
As results, the most significant factors contributing to construction delays are labor shortage, construction mistakes and defective work for the contractor group, coupled with slow decision making for the designer and supervisor group. 
As for the owner or the contractor, the delay emerges from confused statement of work and late delivery of the construction site. 
In addition, lack of collaboration and swing relationships among stakeholders and lack of continuity of the work in its construction phases are major factors affecting delays on construction projects.
