The objective of this research is to develop a paintprogram as a prototype which can handle Thai/English characters,using the object oriented programming technique. 
In addition tothe paint program, software tools are also developed for anygraphic programs in micro computer platforms. 
The tools aregathered into a program library which will ease the furthersoftware development. 
The researcher studied the concept of object orientedprogramming in the first place, then made the technical survey onfunctions of the paint program and the methods required for thosefunctions. 
After designing and building the program library, thepaint program was developed consequently. 
Nevertheless, thepaint program is a prototype which would be one of the best wayfor graphic program development. 
More features on graphicsoftware can be added to the program by means of object orientedprogramming technique.
