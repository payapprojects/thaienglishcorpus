LUCTON SCHOOL
Based in rural Herefordshire and established in 1708, we are one of the top performing and oldest boarding schools in our region, attracting international students from Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. 
Small classes, talented and committed teachers, a friendly atmosphere and a wonderful rural location combine to provide an outstanding, all-round educational experience at Lucton.
An Oxford University admissions tutor commented that the typical thing about Lucton students is that there is no typical student-they are very much individuals! 
What they do have in common is that they leave Lucton confident in their strengths and abilities and ready to embrace opportunities.
We have exceptional facilities for sport including Swimming, Rugby, Basketball and Horse Riding, with some of our students representing Great Britain in international competitions. 
In addition to sport, our boarders enjoy a wealth of weekend activities both cultural and social. 
Offering a wide range of GCSE and A-level subjects, Lucton has a strong academic record and an established tradition of getting the best possible results from each pupil. 
We accept mixed ability students, and in recent years A-level results have averaged 80% A-C grades, with all leavers gaining places at their first choice universities. 
Facilities include junior and senior libraries, science laboratories, ICT rooms, a design and technology workshop, sports hall, tennis courts, indoor swimming pool, many games fields and an Equestrian Centre. 
Senior students enjoy their own sixth-form centre, including library, IT suite, comfortable common room and quiet study area.
