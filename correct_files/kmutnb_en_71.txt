Extraction of essential oil from lemon basil (Ocimum citriodourum) straw using hexane, supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) and hydrodistillation was investigated in this study. 
The extracted samples were subjected to GC-MS to analyze the composition. 
The extraction yield of hexane in Soxhlet extractor was highest as 4.04%. 
The extraction yields of supercritical carbon dioxide (350 bar and 70oC) and hydrodistillation were 1.5% and 0.29%, respectively. 
The main components in essential oil from hexane extraction were caryophyllene oxide, neral, and geranial which were similar to sample from supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. 
The major components in essential oil from hydrodistillation were caryophyllene oxide, trans-alpha-bergamotene and linalool.
