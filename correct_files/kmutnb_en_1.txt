Improvement of Post Peak Behavior of Light Weight Foam Soil with Polypropylene Fiber
This paper presents the improvement of lightweight foam mixed soil (LFS) with polypropylene fibers in soft clay area. 
The study emphasizes the reducing brittle property and increasing the ductile behavior in material. 
A series of the unconfined compression test was conducted on LFS samples with different polypropylene fibers 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4%, cement content 100, 150 and 200 kg/m3. 
The unit weight of samples was set with 8, 10 and 12 kN/m3, and different fibers lengths were 6 and 12 mm. 
The curing time of 7 and 28 days were conducted, respectively. 
The results found that the adding fibers seem better performance on the deformation characteristic where the post-peak behavior could be enhanced as by increasing of the toughness and the residual strength with increasing fiber content, and the reduction rate on loss of post-peak. 
However, the influence of fiber content and the length of fiber has insignificant effect on the increasing the value of unconfined compressive strength.
