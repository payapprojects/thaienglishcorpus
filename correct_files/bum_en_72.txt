Microneurosurgery
Microneurosurgery is a minimally invasive neurosurgery performed using a high quality, high resolution 3-D camera equipped with a surgical microscope. 
This enables physicians to amplify and examine more clearly. 
This improves accuracy and safety, particularly in deep areas of the brain, and allows for more successful surgical outcomes than would otherwise be attained with only the naked eye.

Other Medical Instruments and Equipment Used to Aid in Microneurosurgery
Microneurosurgery may also require the use of other instruments and medical technology in order to increase its effectiveness and allow for even greater surgical success. 
These additional instruments may include:
Ultrasonic aspirator – used to break up and suction tumors  with high frequency ultrasonic sound waves, preserving and protecting surrounding blood vessels and, as a result, causing little or no bleeding during surgery 
Nerve stimulator – used to locate and identify nerves adjacent  to tumors, allowing doctors to perform surgical procedures more precisely  
Use of fluorescent dye in some types of tumors – allowing surgeons to locate and distinguish tumor cells and blood vessels more clearly 
Benefits of Microneurosurgery
Reduced impact to tissue at the surgical site and surrounding areas, causing less tissue trauma, and thus less post-surgical pain at the incision site
Faster recovery and shorter postoperative hospital stays 
Greater surgical accuracy and safety, thus minimizing complications
