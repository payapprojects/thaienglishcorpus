Warwick is a world-leading university with the highest academic and research standards.
Born out of boldness, imagination and collaboration, from the moment the first students arrived in 1965, we’ve been forward-focused.
We’re one of the UK’s top 10 universities, 54th in the world (QS World University Rankings 2019), and in the world’s top 100 universities for graduate employability (The QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2018).
The 2014 Research Excellence Framework placed us 7th among UK research universities, meaning you’ll learn alongside academics at the cusp of new thinking. 
In 2016/17 we allocated over £36 million of scholarship funding to postgraduate students, helping outstanding individuals to deepen their knowledge, and reach the next level of their career.
Our specialist international team will support you from application through to graduation. 
The Welcome to Warwick programme will help you and fellow international students from over 150 countries feel at home on campus before term even begins.
Our campus also offers you access to a great transport network if you want to travel around the UK or Europe while you’re here.
You’ll have the potential to go anywhere if you bring your energy and determination to succeed. 
What that success looks like is up to you.
