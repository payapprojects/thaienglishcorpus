Moisture Content (MC), water activity (Aw) and solubility of the encapsulated powders significantly decreased when concentration of carrier increased from 10 to 30% (p < 0.05). 
However, the powders from GA gave better solubility than those of MD. 
Morphological study revealed that the powders had larger particle size and less in bulk density when concentration of carriers increased. 
In addition, Total Phenolic Content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (DPPH) significantly decreased when encapsulated holy basil in MD and GA (p < 0.05). 
Therefore, using 10% GA as a carrier was selected for second experiment. 
Increasing of inlet temperature did not affect solubility but significantly affected MC, Aw, bulk density, particle size, lightness, TPC and DPPH (p < 0.05). 
Using 140°C resulted in the highest TPC and DPPH activity compared to the other treatment during in vitro digestion. 
In conclusion, the suitable condition of holy basil powder by spray drying was using 10% GA at 140°C inlet temperature.
