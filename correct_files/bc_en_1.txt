Our work in society
We seek to support societies whose young people, citizens and institutions contribute to and benefit from a more inclusive, open and prosperous world.
Our work in society helps people and organisations contribute to a more secure, inclusive and prosperous world. 
We partner with civil society organisations, government ministries and institutions in the UK, Thailand and around the world to deliver high quality programmes such as ‘Skills for Social Entrepreneurs’. 
This scheme supports social enterprises which employ business approaches to meet social and environmental needs and make a positive impact in their local community, drawing on UK expertise. 
It focuses on four core strands, namely: policy & government engagement, capacity building, higher education and international development.
