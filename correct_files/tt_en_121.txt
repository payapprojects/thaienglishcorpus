This thesis presents the construction of a medical instrument known as a pulse oximeter. 
The development of noninvasive pulse oximeter for real time measurement of oxygen saturation in blood is described. 
The optical technique is used in this instrument by passing two light beams of different wavelengths through human tissue. 
The transmitted light intensities is detected by photodiode. 
The implemented software is used to control and convert the detected signals to the blood owygen saturation. 
Results obtained from the tested samples investigation have shown that this noninvasive pulse oximeter data has an arror at an acceptable level of -2 percent of oxygen saturation (SpO(,2)) compared with that of the standard instrument.
