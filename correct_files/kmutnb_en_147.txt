The objectives of this research are 1) to identify the causal factors influencing the job performance of employees in telecommunications industry; 2) to compare the job performances of employees in telecommunications industry; 3) to study the attributes of employees in telecommunications industry with achievement motivation and to identify ways to develop achievement motivation among employees in telecommunications industry; and 4) to develop and investigate the effects of programs in developing the achievement motivation and job performance of employees in telecommunications industry. 
This research divided into 3 phases consisiting of phase 1 which was survey research conducted for objective 1 and 2, phase 2 which was qualitative research with focus group discussion and interview conducted for objective 3 and phase 3, which was experimental research conducted for objective 4. 
The subjects for all phases were state enterprise employees in telecommunications industry in Thailand. 
The subjects of phase 1, 2 and 3 were 520, 12 and 40 employees respectively. 
The results of the findings were as follows: 1) after modifying the model, the statistics regarding the fit of the models were χ2/df = 1.296 (χ2 = 86.82, df = 67), p-value = .052, GFI = 0.980, AGFI = 0.958, NFI = 0.991, CFI = 0.998, CN = 577.407, SRMR = 0.032, and RMSEA = 0.024, all of which exceeded the required criteria. 
It can be concluded that; 1) the model fit with the empirical data; 2) the employees who differed in marital status and age showed differences in job performance at .01 and .05 levels of significance respectively; 3) the attributes of employees with achievement motivation were responsible, ambitious, to be competitive, to have job knowledge and plans and the achievement goals of the employees would develop their achievement motivation in terms of having a mentor or role model and arranging onsite and offsite activities; and 4) the results analyzed by the Mann–Whitney U Test revealed that after the quasi-experiment, the achievement motivation of employees, in terms of different training methods, resulted in a job performance with a .01 level of significance (Mann-Whitney U = 98.500; p-value = .006). 
The employees trained by role models showed a higher level of job performance (mean rank = 25.58) than those who were trained using group activities. 
(mean rank = 15.43). 
The results analyzed by the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test showed differences in the job performance of employees at a .01 level of statistical significance (Z = –5.284; p-value = .000). 
The job performance level of the employees after the quasi-experiment (mean rank = 56.86) were higher than before (mean rank = 24.14).
