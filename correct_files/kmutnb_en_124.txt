The Development of Hazardous Route Map in Thailand
The aim of this research paper is to test the possibility of combining the navigation system with the data collected to show Thailand’s black spots for people traveling by car. 
The study uses the rate-quality control method to analyze the statistical data collected between B.E. 
2551–2554 in order to show Thailand’s most dangerous roads. 
This research has improved the Global Positioning System device with the most functional and user-friendly interface to warn drivers of the accident spots where they are most at risk of being involved in an accident. 
The result of this research shows that the system has the capability to detect hazardous driving events and warn drivers of the potential dangers from the 1 km distance to the incident black spot.
