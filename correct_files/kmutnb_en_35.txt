Physicochemical Properties and Sensory Quality of Gluten-free Brown Rice Pasta Enriched with Egg White Protein
Gluten free (GF) products are increasingly interested worldwide. 
The objective of this research was to develop gluten-free pasta from brown rice flour enriched with egg white protein and to evaluate physicochemical quality and consumer acceptability of developed gluten-free brown rice pasta formulations. 
Composite flour from Brown Rice Flour (BRF) and Pre-gelatinized Cassava Starch (PGCS) (BRF : PGCS at 100 : 0, 95 : 5 and 90 : 10), egg white powder (EWP at 5 and 10%, w/w), and xanthan gum (XG at 5 and 10%, w/w) were applied using full factorial in CRD to produce gluten-free pasta. 
Developed pasta was subjected to physicochemical properties including cooking time, cooking loss, water absorption, and hardness using texture analyser. 
Sensory evaluation using 9-point hedonic scale (with and without pasta sauce) (n=50) for the selected GF pasta which had low cooking loss was conducted and served using sequential monadic for 4 samples of each set with counterbalanced serving. 
The results showed that at the same level of EWP, as the levels of PGCS and XG increased, cooking time, cooking loss and water absorption increased. 
The hardness of GF pasta decreased as the level of PGCS increased. 
Sensory quality showed that pasta containing BRF : PGCS/EWP/XG at the level of 95 : 5/10/5 gained the highest liking score in terms of appearance, aroma, texture as well as overall liking, both with and without pasta sauce. 
The purchase intention of the selected GF pasta was up to 78%. 
The protein content was 12.1% which was comparable to the protein content of the commercial wheat pasta based on a serving size of 50 g.
