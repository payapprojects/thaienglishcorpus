Risk Assessment of Thermal Hazard and Reactivity of Hydrogen Peroxide by Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent containing a peroxide functional group that easily decomposes. 
In this research, a commercial grade of 50% w/w hydrogen peroxide was evaluated for thermal hazard and reactivity by differential scanning calorimetry. 
It was found that the calculated activation energy using the Flynn/Wall/Ozawa equation was 72.0 kJ/mol. 
The risk assessment of thermal hazard evaluated in terms of the averages of adiabatic decomposition temperature rise and time-tomaximum rate, were 363.4 K and 36.0 seconds, respectively. 
The risk assessment of reactivity, evaluated from instantaneous power density was 40.7 kW/cm3. 
The instability and the harzadous chemical reaction rating have shown at the level of 4. 
It can be concluded that the 50% w/w of hydrogen peroxide by itself with possibility of detonation, explosive decomposition or chemical reaction explosion at normal temperature and pressure. 
Therefore, the storage, transportation and usage must be done with extra caution and by qualified person who has been trained or by the chemist who is knowledgeable in chemical.
