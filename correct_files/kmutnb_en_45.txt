During festivals or long weekend, people often drive to travel or visit their hometown, which results in a great number of cars on many major highways. 
It is observed that the traffic stream on these highways flows under stop-and-go condition due to the occurrence of bottlenecks. 
This study aimed to explore ways to locate the bottlenecks on highways. 
Data were collected by driving along Mittraphap Road from Nakhon Ratchasima to Khon Kaen during the beginning of New Year (December 27â€“29, 2013), which was a total of 16 trips. 
Each trip started every three hours and a designated survey form was used to record the locations of the bottlenecks as well as factors contributing to their occurrences. 
The findings revealed 97 locations of the bottlenecks and 12 factors causing their occurrences. 
Binary logistic regression model was utilized to analyze and build forecasting models, which differed primarily in such factors as types of gas stations and overpasses. 
It was found that the most efficient model was the model using PTT gas stations and unclassified overpasses.
