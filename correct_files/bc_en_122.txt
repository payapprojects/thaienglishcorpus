Our Assessment
Students are assessed and graded through the following means:
Modular progress tests
Project tasks
Speaking (continuous assessment)
Homework
Effort and participation
If students require formal, independent assessment then our Examinations team can assist in organising tests such as IELTS, iGCSE or Aptis. 
In each case, our approach to assessment is positive, professional and fair.
