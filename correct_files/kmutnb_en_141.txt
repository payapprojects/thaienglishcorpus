Effect of Roasting Conditions on Beany Odor Retention and Chemical Properties of Sacha Inchi Flour
Beany odor is a unique flavor of bean products, which is not desired by consumers. 
The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of roasting conditions on the retention of beany odor and chemical properties of Sacha Inchi flour. 
The roasting temperature varied as 70, 90 and 120°C combined with roasting time for 15 and 30 minute were carried out. 
The result showed that the conditions used could reduce the beany odor. 
Both roasting temperature and time had an effect on lipoxygenase activity and beany odor intensity (p < 0.05) as well as roasting temperature influenced moisture content (p < 0.05). 
Roasting Sacha inchi flour by roasting at 120°C for 15 minute was found to be an optimum condition. 
The comparison result of chemical qualities of Sacha inchi flour with and without roasting was significantly difference (p < 0.05). 
Roasted Sacha inchi flour through 120°C for 15 minute contained moisture, protein, fat, crude fiber, ash, total dietary fiber and total phenolic compounds lower than Sacha inchi flour without roasting treatment (p < 0.05).
