The Influence of NaOH Concentration on Compressive Strength of Fly Ash Concrete
This research studied the influence of NaOH concentration on the compressive strength of fly ash concrete. 
Fly ash was used to replace Portland cement type I at the percentages of 40, 50, and 60 by weight of binder. 
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was introduced as an alkaline activator at various molar concentrations of 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 molar. 
Concrete cube specimens of 100×100×100 mm3 had been cast. 
The specimens were cured in tab water for 3, 7, 14, 28, and 60 days and their compressive strengths were determined. 
Based on the results, compressive strength of fly ash concretes tended to increase as the concentration of NaOH solution increase for no more than 0.50 molar. 
Higher amount of fly ash in concretes also reduced their compressive strengths and a greater reduction was found in concretes without any activator of NaOH solution. 
In summary, the use of NaOH solution at 0.50 molar concentration in concrete containing fly ash at 50% by weight of binder would be optimal due to its highest compressive strength, which was 22% higher than that of the control concrete.
