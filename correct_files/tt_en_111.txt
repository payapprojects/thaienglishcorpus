Post operative pain is an acute pain which affects physical and mental aspects.
Therefore, nurses play important roles in reducing pain by selecting an appropriate practice. 
Massage is one method which can reduce pain and has a good effect on the physical and mental aspects. 
The purpose of this study was to study the effects of massage on pain level in post abdominal operative patients. 
The sample was a purposive sample which consisted of 10 patients who had gall bladder, stomach, and/or intestinal diseases and who were receiving an abdominal operation at Siriraj Hospital. 
Instruments included the handbook of massage and the data collection instruments. 
The data collection instruments consisted of three parts : demaographic data record form, pain assessment record form and interview form. 
During the first three days after operation, the patients were massaged five times on the shoulders, neck, back, lower legs and feet for thirty minutes. 
Before and after massage, the pain sensation, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate of the patients was measured and their behavioral response to pain was observed. 
After the fifth massage, the patients were interviewed regarding their perception toward the massage. 
The data were collected during February to March 2001 and analyzed by using frequency, mean and standard deviation. 
The results showed that the mean scores of pain sensation and behavioral response to pain, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure of the patients decreased after massage. 
The mean duration during which the patients started to report increased surgical wound pain after massage was 2.52 hours and every patient reported that they liked the massage which they received. 
These findings suggest that nurses should include massage as one of the nursing interventions to reduce pain in post abdominal operative patients along with analgesic therapy. 
Further study should be done using a quasi-experimental design.
