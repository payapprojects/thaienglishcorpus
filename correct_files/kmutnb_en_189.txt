Synthesis of Waveguide Band-Pass Filter using K-inverter Technique for Microwave Engineering Education
This research presents a synthesis of waveguide band-pass filter using the K-inverter technique for microwave engineering education. 
The simulator based on the K-inverter technique was developed using the GUI function of MATLAB®. 
The band pass filter was synthesized using the Chebyshev approximation theory and the K-inverter technique to design the structure of inductive iris filter in waveguide. 
The designed BPF filter was implemented in operating frequency range of 8.35–8.65 GHz and tested in comparison to a commercial simulator. 
The simulated results of designed waveguide BPF filter using developed simulator are consistent to commercial simulator and filter theory. 
The designed waveguide band-pass filter using the K-inverter technique can be implemented and used effectively as a prototype filter in engineering education.
