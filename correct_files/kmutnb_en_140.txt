Effect of Load Transfer Platform Stiffness on Differential Settlement of Deep Cement Mixing Pile Supported Embankment
This study aimed at investigating the settlement behavior of Deep Cement Mixing (DCM) improved ground under embankment loading with the different types of Load Transfer Platform (LTP). 
The settlement behavior was studied by field embankment construction with instrumentation. 
The load transfer mechanism was investigated by numerical analysis. 
From the obtained results, it was found that the load transfer mechanism (arching effect) could be improved by increasing the LTP stiffness with cement admixture. 
Larger portion of embankment load was transferred to the DCMs. 
The settlement of the surrounding soil consequently decreased. 
Therefore, increase of LTP stiffness could reduce the differential settlement between DCM and the surrounding soil.
