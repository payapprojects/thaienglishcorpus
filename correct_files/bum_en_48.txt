Gastrointestinal Motility Planning
Two types of GI tract function evaluation:
Anorectal Manometry is used to assess chronic constipation which suggests malfunction of colon, diaphragm, or sphincter, which can cause difficulty in passing stool. 
It may be administered to babies suffering from constipation from birth, if there is suspicion of rectal nerve defect.
Esophageal Manometry is a test to assess the function of esophagus and upper and lower esophagus sphincter. 
It is usually given to those who have difficulty swallowing, have chest pain, or other diseases related to malfunction of the esophagus. 
It can also test the function of the stomach and in patients suspected of stomach malfunction.
