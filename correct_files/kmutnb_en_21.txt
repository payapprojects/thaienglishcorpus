Field Strength Assessment of Recycled Base Course by Dynamic Cone Penetration (DCP) Test
During pavement rehabilitation, there is a need to assess the field strength of base course for quality inspection. 
The indirect approach for controlling the strength is field density test by sand cone method and unconfined compression test on field compacted sample. 
However the field and laboratory strengths are different due to the effects of gradation and compaction energy. 
The Dynamic Cone penetration (DCP) has been extensively used to evaluate the field penetration resistance of base and subbase layers. 
In this research, the DCP was investigated and used to assess the field strength of recycled base course from pavement in−place recycling. 
The calibration of DCP and unconfined compression tests were performed on base course model under various Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP), cement and moisture contents. 
A new modified Penetration index (PI*) have been proposed for DCP test of compacted soil−RAP−cement. 
The correlation equation between PI* and qu have presented and discussed. 
The field tests were performed for investigating the performance of pavement recycling of base course by using DCP test. 
The pavement rehabilitation of Highway 24 in Nakhon Ratchsima, Thailand has assessed by DCP test. 
The field strength by DCP test has reported and compared with those of field hand compaction strength and strength requirement for soil cement base.
