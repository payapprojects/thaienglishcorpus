Concrete Block from Recycled Asphalt Concrete
This research aims to examine the use of stone dust from recycled asphalt concrete aggregate in concrete block products. 
The mixture ratio of portland cement type1: stone dust or recycled asphalt concrete aggregate: water is 1: 6 : 0.4 by weight. 
Types of stone dust from recycled asphalt concrete aggregate and limestone mine (general aggregate) are compared in concrete block properties. 
The concrete block samples are cast in 7×19×39 cubic centimeter of dimension with a concrete block molding machine. 
The concrete block sample testing follows the TIS 58-2530 on non-load bearing concrete blocks. 
As results, the compressive strength and water absorption of recycled asphalt concrete are lower than general concrete blocks. 
All samples can classify as the standard so it can be used as material for a wall. 
All samples have passed the TIS standard. 
Thus, concrete blocks from recycled asphalt concrete can be used for wall construction purposes.
