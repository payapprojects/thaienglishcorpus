The complication of diabetes millitus is a chronic condition which deteriorates pateints health, and can lead to death. 
Cardiovascular disease is an important cause of death in diabetes millitus. 
It can be prevented through extensive changes in the pateints lifestyle concerning self-care behavior. 
The objective of this quasi-experiment research is to assess the effectiveness of a health education program by applying Rogers Protection Motivation Theory in the prevention of coronary heart disease in diabetes millitus patients. 
The study group consisted of females who attended the diabetes mellitus clinic at Udonthani Hospital. 
This group represents the group at risk for high blood sugar and/or high cholesterol. 
The group was divided into two groups, 40 in each. 
One group, the experimental group, participated in the 12 week health education program. 
The other group was the comparison group. 
The data were collected by interview questionnaires, record forms and laboratory examination of the level of blood sugar and cholesterol. 
The results showed that after participating in the health education program, the experimental group had a significantly greater improvement in perceived severity and susceptibility to coronary heart disease, self-efficacy, response efficacy, intention of and carrying out of coronary heart disease preventive behavior about exercise, than the comparison group. 
After the experiment, the experimental group and the control group had no significant difference in preventive behavior about eating. 
Levels of blood sugar and cholesterol of the experimental group were also decreased significantly. 
Thus, this health program should be applied at the diabetes millitus clinics in other hospitals.
