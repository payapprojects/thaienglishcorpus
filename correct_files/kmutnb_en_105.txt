Estimating the Population Mean Using Searls Approach
The Searls approach was employed to develop the estimation of population mean based on the coefficient of variation of the known population. 
This approach leads to a higher efficiency of the Searls estimator than that of the traditional one. 
This article presents the Searls approachâ€™s methods and provides examples of the population mean estimators using the Searls approach: the estimator using the Searls approach for simple random sampling without replacement and the estimator using the Searls approach for single-stage cluster sampling with simple random sampling without replacement
