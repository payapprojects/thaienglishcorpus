The Mechanical Properties and Thermal Conductivity of Concrete Block from Agricultural Wastes
The research article presents the mechanical properties and thermal conductivity of concrete blocks from agricultural wastes. 
The standard mix ratio of cement: stone: sand: water was 3 : 12 : 8 : 1.3 wt%. 
The percentage of sugarcane and corn leaves replacing cement was 4, 6, 8, 10 wt%. 
Mechanical properties and thermal conductivity in terms of compressive strength, water absorption, density thermal conductivity and ultrasonic pulse velocity were studied. 
The results showed that when replacing cement with sugarcane leaves 4% by cement weight, thermal conductivity, density and compressive strength decreased, while water absorption increased. 
Replacing cement with sugarcane leaves yielded better mechanical properties and thermal conductivity than replacing with corn leaves. 
Ultrasonic pulse velocity is used to test the compressive strength and density, which are two important indices to characterize mechanical properties of concrete blocks. 
Concrete blocks of sugarcane and corn leaves can reduce heat entering a building by up to 53.29% and 54.93%, respectively. 
Concrete blocks from agricultural wasted can be developed into thermal insulators and they are environmentally friendly materials, as well.
