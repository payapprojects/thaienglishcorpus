Set in an easily accessible location in the lovely Park Hill area of Croydon, South London, CTC offers an attractive and safe environment in which each student can flourish.
CTC was founded in 1958 by Roger Osborne, a graduate of Cambridge University. 
Since then we have grown into one of the UK’s leading international Colleges as our reputation for academic excellence has spread globally.
Careful monitoring of academic progress and weekly subject testing lie at the heart of CTC’s commitment to high academic standards and our secret has been to keep class sizes small at no more than 9 and base our teachings on the tutorial style started by Roger Osborne all those years ago.  
It is an approach that works and our exam results are consistently very high. 
In 2015, 56% of A-levels taken were awarded an A or A* grade with a third of all students gaining 3 or 4 A/A* grades.
It is our expert guidance and support during the university application process that also helps to explain why so many CTC students succeed in securing places at leading universities. 
In 2014, a large majority of our students chose to go on to a Russell Group University with many opting for Medicine, Bio sciences, Mathematics, Economics, Finance, Architecture, Law, and Engineering.
Cambridge Tutors College has always provided excellent home stay facilities, and from September 2016 it introduced boarding with 40 en suite rooms for students.
