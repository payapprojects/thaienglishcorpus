Development of Soy Yogurt Drink Fortified with Quinoa and Psyllium Husk
Plant-based food products have been considered as an alternative to health-conscious consumers and consumers with lactose intolerance. 
This research aimed to develop soy yogurt drink fortified with quinoa and psyllium husk and to study consumers’ acceptability on the developed product. 
The study on suitable ratio between soybean and water to produce soy milk was conducted with different ratios by weight including 1 : 3, 1 : 4 and 1 : 5, respectively. 
The yogurt starter cultures were added and were incubated at 43°C for 12 hours. 
After incubation, water was added to soy yogurt with the ratio of 1 : 1 w/w to make soy yogurt drink. 
The preferred ratio between soybean and water for making soy yogurt was 1 : 4. 
Liquid sucrose with different concentrations (0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, and 16% v/v) was mixed into the soy yogurt drink. 
The most liked formula was the one with 8% liquid sucrose. 
Psyllium husk and quinoa were added to soy yogurt drink with three different ratios including 1 : 3, 1 : 5, and 1 : 7 w/w, respectively. 
The ratio of 1 : 5 was the favorite formula. 
Physical, chemical, microbiological and consumers’ acceptability of developed product were determined. 
Soy yogurt drink fortified with quinoa and psyllium husk contained 5.88 ± 0.07% of protein and 5.60 ± 0.13% of crude fiber whereas the product without quinoa and psyllium husk had 1.41 ± 0.09% of protein and 0.59 ± 0.16% of crude fiber. 
Eighty-three percent of consumers accepted the product. 
Sixty-five percent of consumers decided to buy the product if it would be commercially available.
