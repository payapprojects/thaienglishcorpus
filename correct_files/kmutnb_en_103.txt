Adsorption Methylene Blue Dye by Chitosan Flake: Equilibrium and Applied to Use for Industrial Factory
The equilibrium adsorption of methylene blue dye onto chitosan flake has been studied in the batch adsorption model of Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms. 
The effect of initial concentration in range 24.4â€“110.2 mg/L was studied. 
It was found that tendency of adsorption capacity increased with increasing initial concentration of methylene blue. 
The adsorption energy was determined by Dubinin-Radushkevich constant. 
In addition, an equilibrium adsorption capacity of sorption has been evaluated with Langmuir isotherm and operating line methods which can be applied for industrial factory very well. 
At flow rate 1 m3/hr, removal of methylene blue and amount to use of chitosan flake was 7.2 g/hr and 2.0 kg/hr, respectively.
