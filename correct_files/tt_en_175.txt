Essential hypertension is a chronic illness that causes serious health problems. 
It is found in patients who have inappropriate lifestyle patterns. 
Treatment helps the patients to survive longer but they have to take life long medication and they must follow appropriate health-promoting behaviors (HPB). 
The purpose of this research was to study HPB and factors related to HPB, which are the cause of inappropriate health practices. 
The investigator modified Green & Kreuters theory which according to the PRECEDE Framework includes three main factors. 
First, predisposing factors include knowledge about essential hypertension and attitudes toward HPB. 
Enabling factors are the places and equipment used to facilitate HPB. 
Finally, reinforcing factors consist of the positive reinforcing behaviors from significant people such as attention, support and encouragement. 
The subjects of this study were 120 patients with essential hypertension at Bangkok Metropolitan Medical College and Vajira Hospital who were recruited from an eligible population. 
Data were analyzed by percentage, mean, standard deviation and Pearsons Product Moment Correlation Coefficient analysis. 
The results showed that the overall HPB of the subjects were appropriate behaviors . 
There was a positive significant correlation between the overall HPB and the overall attitude to HPB . 
The overall HPB showed a positive significant correlation with both the place and equipment used to facilitate these behaviors  respectively. 
These results suggested that nurses should study about methods to promote attitudes to promote HPB for patients. 
1n addition health care providers should provide a place and equipment to facilitate appropriate HPB to occur.
