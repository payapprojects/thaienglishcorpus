How do we invest in stock dividend?
Stock dividend selection Three major factors are considered to select stock dividend
Should have a strong financial position. 
Be a leader in the business. 
Have a brand or brand that is remembered by customers. 
We need to know and understand the business we are investing in. 
Regularity in dividends This reflects the Company's policy and rigor in paying dividends. 
It may be based on past dividend payout data. 
You can find the stock dividend information on the page. 
"Information summary" on the website of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (www.set.or.th, www.settrade.com)  Dividend stocks are good but dividend should pay more each year. 
For example, from the first year's first dividend of 1 baht, second year should be dividend of 1.10 baht, and third year should be dividend of 1.20 baht. 
If the company can pay more dividends that means the financial health and operations of the company are likely to continue to grow. 
It will give the capitalist a degree of peace of mind.
Do not forget that investment in dividends is a long-term investment to make money work for us. 
In addition, we often find that after the company pays dividends. 
The stock price is equal to or greater than the dividend we have. 
(Dividend payment to shareholders is payout comes from net profit or retained earnings, resulting in a decrease in cash flow.) 
As a result, if we expect only short-term dividends then just want to buy shares to receive dividends and then sell it. 
This may cause us losses at stock prices instead.
Investing in dividend stocks also risk that must be aware of. 
The dividends that are now seen are based on past performance and the past did not indicate the future. 
If investors use only statistical numbers such as dividends in the past then come to invest for the return of dividends. 
It is unlikely that they will get the expected return. 
Sometimes when the company wants to use capital to expand business, the company may not be able to pay dividends as much as it already has.
So what investors should do is study the business (stock) we want to invest. 
Assess future profitability trends which is the best signal to say that the company has a chance to pay dividends continuously? 
And keep track and investigate our investments consistently. 
If this is done. 
Your next stock dividend will have a higher chance of success.
