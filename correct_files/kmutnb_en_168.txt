Price Forecasting of Ribbed Smoked Rubber Sheet No. 3 with a Markov Chain Model
This research proposes a Markov Chain model for forecasting the price of ribbed rubber sheet grade 3 (RSS3) in Thailand. 
The model was parameterized with daily prices from January 2014 to March 2016, with the sample size of 536 sets. 
This study also considers the effect of sample sizes (536 and 196) and the effect of the number of price interval was at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. 
The transition matrix was parameterized for each case, and the daily prices were simulated for 1,000 values. 
The case of 536 samples and 15 intervals and the case of 196 samples at 5 intervals have the mean of absolute percentage error close to 4%.
