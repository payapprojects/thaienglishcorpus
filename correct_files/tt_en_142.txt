The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes ofpharmaceutical care for ischemic heart disease outpatients at Ratchaburihospital during 1 September to 31 December 2002. 
Ninety - eight randomisedpatients were recruited from outpatient clinic. 
The activities inpharmaceutical care include: identifying, preventing and resolving allactual and potential drug therapy problems; monitoring of drug therapy,providing drug information to physicians and counseling to patients. 
The result of study showed 171 drug therapy problems (DTP) in 90patients. 
The most three common types of DTP were noncompliance 111DTP(64.9%) in 70 patients (71.4%), need for additional drug therapy 28DTP(16.4%) in 28 patients(28.6%), and adverse drug reaction 14 DTP (8.2%)in12 patients(12.2%), respectively. 
The most common causes of DTP indescending order were: patients lacked of knowledge about drugs anddisease, physicians lacked of complete information about patients, andmedication errors respectively. 
Of all the DTPs, 37 DTPs(21.6%) wereprevented, 111 DTPs(64.9%) were resolved and 23 DTPs (13.5%) were unsolved.
After pharmacist's intervention, 54 interventions (85.7%) were accepted, 7interventions (11.1%) were partially accepted and 2 interventions (3.2%)were unaccepted. 
Physicians had good attitude and satisfied with thepharmaceutical care as well as the patients and the project should becontinued. 
This study can be concluded that this pharmaceutical care process canimprove the patient care of heart disease and the patients will receivemaximum benefit from drug therapy.
