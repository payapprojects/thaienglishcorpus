Our mission
At the British Council, we help our students reach their fullest potential by encouraging passion of learning English. 
We are committed to providing students with a structured English language learning programme in a stimulating, rewarding and safe environment.
Our approach
All our classes are 100% face-to-face with UK-qualified teachers who have experience in teaching English for kids and teens using a variety of teaching materials  that fit each age group to help them actively learn and concentrate on the lessons in class. 
We believe that genuine face to face interaction between students and with the teacher are the best ways to achieve this and help you learn English.
