Established in 1920, Swansea University is 26th in the UK in the recent Research Excellent Framework (REF), proud winners of the 2014 WhatUni? 
Student Choice Award and Joint 8th in the UK for student satisfaction (NSS, 2015).
In September 2015 we opened our new £450 million Bay Campus which is home to students studying Business, Economics and Engineering. 
This development gives students both state of the art facilities and unrivalled access to industry experts who are co-located on campus.
Our seafront campuses are located within walking distance of Swansea, a cosmopolitan city with a maritime feel.
