British Council Partner Schools and Universities
The British Council has a wealth of experience of working closely with academic institutions in Thailand. 
Operating within the Thai education system, we deliver English tuition to over 4,000 students at partner institutions across the country. 
Our English teaching seeks to nurture in students the confidence to use English in real-life situations. 
This means not just in the classroom but in social and professional contexts. 
We promote creativity and learner autonomy through enjoyable yet challenging activities. 
We assess learners on their progress in class against a range of criteria and provide feedback reports on a range of language competencies. 
At the British Council, we employ the best English language teachers because we believe they are the key to successful learning. 
Our teachers are highly qualified with many years of experience and understand the needs and interests of young learners. 
They encourage students to be actively involved in the learning process and help them to develop their full potential.
