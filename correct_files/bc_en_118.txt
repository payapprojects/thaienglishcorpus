Scarborough College is an independent day and boarding school for children aged 3-18, accommodating boarders from age 11 upwards.  
We also offer a bespoke, individually tailored one year Pre-Sixth Form programme for international students, leading on to the prestigious International Baccalaureate Diploma in our Sixth Form, for all our students.
Scarborough College is nationally recognised each year as one of the top performing IB schools in the UK.  
The College blends 120 years of tradition with a most modern and forward-thinking approach to 21st Century education.  
We pride ourselves on providing an atmosphere where every child is known personally and is both individually challenged and supported so that they maximise their potential within, and outside of, the classroom.  
Our boarding houses provide a 'home from home' family feel where boarders enjoy countless activities which forge friendships for life.Our leavers go on to study at the most prestigious universities both in the UK and abroad.  
They are recognised to be well-rounded, ambitious, interesting and engaging young people who have benefited greatly from the responsibility we regularly give them to lead others in our school community.  
We are reknown for our strong sports performance and for a high level of provision in music and drama.  
We also take full advantage of our wonderful location being only five minutes from the beach, on the doorstep of national parks and historic York.
