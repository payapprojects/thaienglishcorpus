Propagation of electromagnetic waves through arainfall region is affected by both attenuation anddepolarization. 
The depolarization phenomenon causescross-channel interference, which affects performanceof a communications system. 
The study of this problem can be done by measuringthe signal in any links and comparing the measuredresults between the no-rain and raining periods. 
Thisis not convenient for the preliminary study in order tounderstand rain-induced depolarization mechanisms. 
Theauthor has developed an experimental set which canmodel wave propagation through a rainfall region forthe preliminary study. 
This experimental set can beadjusted to change some factors affecting propagationcharateristics. 
These factors come from the theoreticalanalysis. 
The measured results show the differentialattenuation and differential phase shift which areresponsible for the basic depolarization mechanisms.
Although the results are different from the theoreticalresults, this is due to the differences incharacteristics of the real rain and the rain whichcomes from the experimental set. 
Therefore it can beconcluded that the experimental set can be used for thepreliminary study of electromagnetic wavedepolarization due to rain.
