Effect of Chromium Loading on Diatomite for the Synthesis of Dimethyl Ether from Methanol
This research investigates the results of catalytic methanol dehydration for synthesis of dimethyl ether using chromium on diatomite catalyst with different the metal loading. 
The reactions were performed in pack-bed reactor at temperature between 250 to 350Â°C. 
According to the experimental results, the conversion of methanol increased with the increase of chromium loading on diatomite catalyst. 
DME selectivity was up to 99 percent. 
The surface acidity increased due to chromium loading, whereas the surface areas decreased. 
It was found that metal oxide loading and surface acidity affected reaction rates more than the surface area of the catalyst. 
Finally, 15%Cr/DM catalyst give high methanol conversion at 91.7 percent and it has exhibited good stability during the 12 hour experiment. 
The catalyst has shown efficient synthesis of dimethyl ether from methanol.
