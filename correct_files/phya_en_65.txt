Stroke is the top death caused disease next from heart disease and cancer. 
All types of stroke mostly are caused by infarction or by 75% on average. 
For those having the Thrombosis as a cause is about 15-30% while by 14-40% has atherosclerosis as the cause. 
Secondary reason is intracerebral hemorrhage around 11% apart from that there is 5% subarachnoid hemorrhage as the cause.
Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound (TCD)
To screen the cerebral arteries located below base of the brain inside the skull using high frequency around the temporal bones requires 2 megahertz of frequency detector. 
It helps measure the acceleration of blood flow including its direction which tells the exact location.
Benefits of Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound
Access to Occlusion and Stenosis Condition (Stenosis, Occlusion)
Measure the blood flow( the cerebral circulation) especially after the stenosis.
Follow results from diagnosis of certain conditions such as vasospasm or high pressure in the skull.
Provide Detection of patent foramen ovale (cerebral microembolism in right to left cardiac shunts)
Provide Autoregulation Screening which observes the vascular reactivity after the carbon dioxide levels changed in blood.
Symptoms of Stroke
Motor weakness, partial paralysis
Speech slurred, unable to understand conversation
One eye cannot see things along with blurred vision
Feeling dizzy with unstable walk along with nausea or loss of consciousness
In some cases, these symptoms may occur temporarily like 30 minutes, which can make them overlook. 
The temporary symptom called TIA (Transient ischemic attack) A study found that one-ninth of stroke patients having such a symptom could have permanent stroke within 90 days. 
Half numbers of the patients found having it in the first 2 days after warning sign. 
Thus, receiving screening for the best diagnosis and prevention is very essential.
