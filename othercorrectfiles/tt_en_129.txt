OBJECTIVE. 
To study the effectiveness of low doseintravenous theophylline treatment in premature infantswith idiopathic apnea of prematurity.DESIGN. 
Experimental study.SETTINGS. Neonatal unit at chulalongkorn hospital,Bangkok, Thailand.PATIENTS. 
8 premature infants (birth weights range from900-1570 gm. ; 
gestational ages range from 28-30 wk.)
with the diagnosis of apnea of prematurity who had thefrequency of apnea more than or equal to 4 times in 3hrs. 
prior to study period.INTERVENTION. 
all infants received loading dose oftheophylline 2.5 mg/kg intravenously following withmaintenance dose of theophylline 1 mg/kg every 8 hrs.
Respiratory rate, heart rate and peripheral oxygensaturation were continously monitoring by using SystemVI/VIS('TM) Infant Monitoring (Airshield VickersMedical) for 72 hrs. 
after initial treatment.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. 
Apneic rate, theophylline lelvelat 24,48 and 72 hrs. 
before the next dose oftheophylline, side effect of theophylline (tachycardia,hyperglycemia, vomiting, jitteriness, convulsion)
RESULT. 
Rate of apneic attack begins to subside within24 hrs. after treatment in 6 infants. 
After 48 hrs.,the apneic rate is decreased significantly (p=0.049).
Although the apneic rate does not decreased in 2infants at 24 hrs. 
but the severity of apnea isdecreased. 
It is found that serum theophylline levelsof these 2 infants are less than 6.5 mcg/mL (4.57, 6.48mcg/mL) which are lower than the others. 
Serumtheophylline level is gradually increased but does notreach the steady state by 72 hrs. 
The mean level andstandard deviation at 24, 48 and 72 hrs. Are 7.66(2.00), 10.68 (1.92) and 11.81 (1.54) mcg/mLrespectively. 
There is no side effect of theophyllinenoted during the study.
CONCLUSION.
Low does intravenous theophylline treatmentseems to be suitable for the management of idiopathicapnea of prematurity. 
It gives a satisfactory resultwithout side effect.
