Leukemia is a chronic life- threatening disease.
With regard to the disease, symptoms and side effects from chemotherapy, patients should be equipped and prepared to act properly and constantly for self-care. 
This quasi-experimental research aims to study the effect of the supportive nursing care on knowledge and self-care behavior in leukemic patients undergoing chemotherapy. 
The samples were 30 purposively selected leukemic patients undergoing chemotherapy who were admitted to Asadang Department, Siriraj Hospital from May to November 2001. 
The participants were divided into an experimental group and control group with fifteen cases in each. 
The experimental group received supportive nursing care which consisted of assessing patients problems, discussing and collaborating in solving problems, providing education, self-care handbook together with four days of continued visitation. 
The control group received routine nursing care and the self-care handbook. 
Both groups were interviewed on the their knowledge and self-care behavior in a pretest and a posttest on the sixth day after the intervention. 
Data analysis used inferential statistics for percentage, mean score, Wilcoxon sign rank test, and Mann-Whitney U test. 
The research results found that there were no differences between the experimental group and the control group in their age, sex, and education level. 
After intervention, the experimental group had significantly higher average score on the knowledge and self-care behavior than before intervention .
The experimental group had significantly higher average score on their knowledge and self-care behavior than control group.
The research results suggest that supportive nursing care should be used to promote self-care in leukemic patients undergoing chemotherapy by providing knowledge together with media and self-care handbook. 
Continuous visiting in order to assess patients knowledge and self-care behaviors should also implemented.
