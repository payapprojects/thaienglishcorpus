The purposes of this descriptive research were 
1) to determine the relationships between self-care agency in each dimension: dietary control, exercise, medication management, self-evaluation and prevention of hypo-hyperglycemia, hygiene care and foot care, and stress management and diabetic control 
2) to predict diabetic control from each dimension of self-care agency in type 2 diabetic patients. 
Purposive sampling was used to select 123 patients from the Diabetic clinic, Banpong Hospital, Ratchaburi Province. 
The following instruments were used to collect the data: demographic data, self-care agency in each dimension and glycemic goal was glycosylated hemoglobin. 
Descriptive statistics, Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, and Stepwise Multiple Regression Analysis were used for data analysis. 
The results of this study revealed that there was no statistically significant relationship between self-care agency in each dimension: dietary control, exercise, medication management, self-evaluation and prevention of hypo-hyperglycemia, hygiene care and foot care, and stress management and diabetic control. 
So the results revealed that each dimension of self-care agency could not predict diabetic control. 
The results of this study are incompatible with theory and inconsistent with previous studies. 
The subjects there were the sense of overestimating their self-care agency and all of them were in the adult group with the expectation of a desired outcome, so they may responded to the questionnaire with socially desirable answers. 
Standardized diabetic education program, teaching package, and the knowledge of healthcare provider are necessary to improve diabetic control.
