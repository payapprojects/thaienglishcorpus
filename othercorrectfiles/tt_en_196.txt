Research sampleswere 40 patients which were equally assigned into one experimental group and one control groupby matching with means of medication adherence behaviors score. 
Research instruments weredischarge planning program developed by the researcher and medication adherence behaviors scalewhose reliability coefficient was .90. 
Medication adherence behavior data were analyzed by t-test. 
Major findings were as follows: 
1. Medication adherence behaviors in schizophrenic patients after participated in dischargeplanning program, were significantly higher than those before the experiment, at the .05 level. 
2. Medication adherence behaviors in schizophrenic patients who participated in dischargeplanning program, was significantly higher than those of patients who participated in regularnursing activities, at the .05 level.
