The purpose of this classroom-based research study is to investigate factors affecting learners who have high productive participation but low language achievement and vice versa. 
The students who took part in this study were 40 M.4/4 students from Islamic College of Thailand, Bangkok. 
There are 4 subjects selected from the results of the analysis of observation checksheet and students midterm examination. 
The first two students had high participation but low achievement and the other two had high achievement but low participation. 
A semi-structured interview was used to find the factors affecting the mismatches between learners productive participation and their language achievement. 
The findings of this research study reveal that the main factor affecting such mismatches was learners different approaches in developing second language acquisition. 
The reason why some learners had high oral participation but low scores was that they had experience and confidence in using English for real communication but they lacked strategies to cope with the language learnt in the classroom and assessed in the test. 
On the other hand, the reason why some learners had high scores but low oral participation was that they had strategies to assist them in learning language in class and in the test but they lacked experience and confidence to use language for communication in real situations. 
Implications for teaching and for assessment are also suggested. 
In teaching, learning strategies should be introduced to the learners to learn language effectively and successfully. In testing, a balanced proportion of skills should be considered in making tests since language learning is composed of four skills. 
Moreover, continuous assessment is another option for the teacher to take into consideration.
