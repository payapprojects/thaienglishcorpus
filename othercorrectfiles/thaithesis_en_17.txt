The objective of this research is to study the use of massmedia by the Catholic Social communications Center of Thailand toevangelize the Catholic principles. 
Results indicate that the Catholic Social CommunicationsCenter of Thailand has been designated by the Vatigan to transmitthe Catholic ideology by using mass media as a means to link theCatholic institution and the Thai public. 
The Center operatesunder the structure of a non-profit, voluntary organization. 
The Center has adopted the social marketing approach as itsmass media strategy. 
As a result, it uses mass media primarily tocreate the awareness and the understanding of the religion amongthe public, but not as much to induce belief or faith, to createthe acceptance of the ideology or to turn the Catholic principlesinto practices.
