The differential growth of skeletal and soft tissuecomponents within the craniofacial complex has an influenceon facial appearance. 
The purpose of this thesis weredesigned to investigate not only the relationship betweennasal form and skeletal pattern in Thai population but alsonasal form and age among sex. 
The knowledges from thisresearch would be benefit for orthodontic diagnosis andtreatment planning and also provides basis for furtherresearches. 
The lateral cephalometric radiographs used in thisstudy were obtained from the department of orthodontics,faculty of dentistry, Chulalongkorn University. 
The 400samplings (200 males and 200 females) were selectedpurposively from Thai populations between the age of 10 to20. 
The criteria of samples were healthy and untreatedorthodontics. 
The soft tissue nasal form and its skeletalpattern were studied from the lateral cephalometry. 
There was statistical correlation between nasal formand skeletal pattern at 0.001 level.
Moreover, there wasstatistical correlation between nasal form and age among sexat 0.001 level.
