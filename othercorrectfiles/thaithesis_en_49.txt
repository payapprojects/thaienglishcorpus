This thesis presents the design and implementationof the experiment sets for digital communicationsystems using Thai language. 
This suite of softwarebased experiment sets operates on a microcomputer. 
Themain objective is to support or assist the userlearning and understanding more about digitalcommunication systems theory. 
Moreover They alsoeliminate the limitations of hardware based experimentsets using nowadays. 
The software tools used are MATLAB version 4.2cl,as a computing engine, together with Microsoft WordThai Edition version 6.0a, as a user interface, and theMicrosoft Internet Assistant hyperlinking allexperiments together. 
These experiments use command line input as themain user interface to allow more flexibility inexploring the variation. 
The user can interact withthese experiments at two different levels. 
At the basiclevel, the user follows the demo-like experiments andchanges parameters with guidance of the questions orhis curiosity. 
The user can observe the results andcompare and compare with theoretical predictions. 
Atthe advanced level, the user can create the whole newexperiments using the previously learned buildingblocks or functions.
