The purpose of this study is to describe symptom experiences, symptom outcomes and management strategies of asthmatic-attack in asthmatic patients. 
A model for Symptom Management developed by Larson, et al. 
(1994) was applied as the conceptual framework of the study. 
Thirty asthmatic patients attending the Medical out-patient clinic at Ramathibodi Hospital, during March through May 1997 were purposively selected. 
Based on the protection of human subjects, the in-depth interview was performed by the investigator. 
Content analysis was used for analyzing the data. 
The results reveal that the asthmatic-attack was induced from a variety of stimuli, and usually occurred at night and in the early hours of the morning. 
The significant symptom all patients experienced was dyspnea. The additional symptoms were shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing, coughing, and increased mucous production. 
The patients responses to the symptoms included: weakness, fatigue, anxiety, fear and afraid of dying. The attack impacted on patients life and health. 
The management strategies were categorized into short-term and long-terrn strategies. 
The short-term strategies were used to alleviate acute episode, whereas the long-term strategies used to prevent the attack by managing self and environment. The results support that the symptom management of asthmatic-attack is a dynamic process aimed not only at relieving and preventing the attack but also alleviating the symptom outcomes. 
It is the deliberate action all patients initiate from interpreting the meaning of symptom experiences This knowledge will be useful for nurses to develop a model for educating the patients to manage the attack with effective strategies.
