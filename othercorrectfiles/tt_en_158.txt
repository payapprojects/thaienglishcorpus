The objective of this prospective, non-randomized, controlled trial was to determine the impactof physician-pharmacist collaboration on lipid management in diabetic patients at the Bangkok MetropolitanAdministration General Hospital compared with usual care. 
The primary outcome was the achievement rateof LDL-C goal. 
The secondary outcomes included changes in lipid parameters, changes in usage rate of lipid modifyingagents, types and acceptance rates of pharmacist's interventions. 
One hundred and 108 patients were enrolled intothe usual care and the intervention groups, respectively. 
Baseline demographics and lipid parameters were similarbetween two groups. 
At the end of the study, the mean LDL-C was significantly lower in the intervention group(111.8 ± 33 mg/dL vs 124.8 ± 37 mg/dL; p = 0.008). 
The proportion of patients who reached the LDL-Ctarget of < 100 mg/dL in the intervention group was significantly higher than those in the usual care group(39.8% vs 25.0%; p = 0.023). 
Beneficial changes in other lipid parameters in favor of the intervention group were alsoobserved. 
Overall, clinical pharmacists made 60 interventions regarding the modification of lipid lowering therapy,21 of these were accepted. 
Sixty interventions on treatment monitoring were made, 32 were accepted by physicians significantly more patients in the intervention group received statin therapy. 
In conclusion, physician-pharmacist collaboration could effectivelyincrease the achievement rate of LDL-C targets in diabetic patients compared with the usual care. 
The findings of ourstudy support the benefits of multidisciplinary approach in dyslipidemia management.
