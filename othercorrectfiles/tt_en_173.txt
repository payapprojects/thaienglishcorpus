The purposes of this case study were to describe nausea and vomiting experiences, and nausea and vomiting management strategies in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. 
The conceptual framework of the study was a model of Symptom Management. 
Purposive sampling was used to select hospitalized cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy admitted over 2 days at Ramathibodi Hospital, during January through March, 2000. 
The instrument used for data collection was an interview questionnaire for nausea and vomiting. 
The data was presented by the individuals and summarized. 
Content analysis was used for analyzing the data. 
The study found that the perceptions of nausea and vomiting were dizziness, abdominal discomfort, chest discomfort, increased salivation, and ultimately nausea and vomiting. 
The evaluation of nausea and vomiting found that the major factor stimulating nausea and vomiting was smell of food, and the symptoms of nausea and vomiting were most severe on day 1 after undergoing chemotherapy and slightly decreasing on days 2 through 7. 
The symptom of nausea and vomiting effected both physiological and psychological responses, such as feeling of weakness, and distress. 
The nausea and vomiting management used most often by the patients was cleaning the mouth with normal saline. 
Family members often responded to nausea and vomiting by giving encouragement, eg. 
talking and touching softly, whereas nurses often responded to nausea and vomiting by giving antiemetic drugs. 
As for the outcome of nausea and vomiting management, a very effective method for the patient was reducing activities, being given encouragement from family members and being given antiemetic drugs from nurses. 
The results support the model of Symptom Management of Larson, et al. 
and can be used as information and guidance for nursing intervention.
