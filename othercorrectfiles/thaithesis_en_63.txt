The objectives of this research were to study the general status of the variables that affected the students achievement on test scores of educational quality courses, to compare the achievements classified by different independent variables, and to formulate regression equation or predicting equation for students achievement on test scores of educational quality courses. 
The population used in this study consisted of 107 post degree students from every field and major of the academic year 1998. 
The data were analyzed by using SPSS for Windows Version 9.0 to obtain statistical values by means of Cronbachs Alpha Coefficient, t-test, F-test and Multiple Regression Analysis. 
The research results were as follows: 
1. The general status that affected the students achievement on test scores of educational quality course in English were their fathers occupation and the highest education of their parents. 
2. The independent variables or predicting variables that affected the students achievement on test scores of educational quality course in Thai were five variables chosen according to priority of significance as follows: 
grade point average in Thai (X(,3)), training before testing (X(,2)), sex (X(,1)), and students attitude toward Thai (X,4) were significant at the 0.01 level while the average of parents income (X(,8)) was significant at 0.05. 
The regression equation or predicting equation of raw scores for the students achievement on test scores of educational quality course in Thai was: Y=14.349 + 5.223X(,3) + 6.132X(,2) + 4.928X(,1) + 2.872X(,14) + 1.287X(,8) The regression equation or predicting equation of standard scores for the students achievement on test scores of educational quality course in Thai was: Y= .363X(,3) + .428X(,2) + .321X(,1) + .211X(,14) + .174X(,8) 
3. The independent variable or predicting variable that affected the students achievement on test scores of educational quality course in English was the grade point average in English (X(,3)) which was significant at the 0.01 level. 
The regression equation or predicting equation of raw scores for the students achievement on test scores of educational quality course in English was: Y=18.771 + 11.076X(,3) The regression equation or predicting equation for standard scores of the students achievement on test scores of educational quality course in English was: Y= .249X(,3) 
4. The independent variables or predicting variables that affected the students achievement on test scores of educational quality course in Computer were two variables chosen according to priority of significance as follows: training before testing (X(,2)) was significant at the 0.01 level while grade point average of the second semester of academic year 1998(X(,5)) was significant at 0.05. The regression equation or predicting equation of raw scores for the students achievement on test scores of educational quality course in Computer was: Y=-1.556 + 12.183X(,2) + 11.603X(,5) The regression equation or predicting equation of standard scores for the students achievement on test scores of educational quality course in Computer was: Y= .454X(,2) + .300X(,5)
