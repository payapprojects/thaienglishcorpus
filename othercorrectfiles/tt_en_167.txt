The purpose of this study, a randomized clinical trial design, was to test the effects of a self-care promotion program on quality of life and reduction of risk factors for coronary disease patients. 
The population of the study was patients with coronary heart disease who were followed-up at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from May to December 2002. 
Thirty-four patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. 
The self-care promotion program was developed by using Orems nursing theory and Ornishs heart disease reversal program as a conceptual framework. 
The control group received usual care whereas the experimental group received usual care plus the self-care promotion program. 
Changes in body weight, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and quality of life from baseline and at 4 months follow-up of the control group were compared with the experimental group. 
Quality of Life Index-Cardiac version IV (Ferrans & Power, 1998) was used for measuring quality of life. 
Reliability of the instrument tested by use of Cronbachs coefficients a was .79. 
The results revealed that the mean body weight in the experimental group decreased significantly compared with the control group (p<.05). LDL and quality of life remained unchanged (p> .05). 
These findings suggest that an educational class for knowledge and training in self-care for who are reduction of risk factors as well as continued supportive measures can assist patients who are overweight or obese to reduce their body weight within 4 months.
