Renal transplantation is currently recognized as the best method of treatment for end-stage renal disease patientsand can enhance the patients' quality of life. 
However, the most common problems in post renal transplantationpatients are infection and renal rejection. 
These causes may be due to a patient's pathology or incorrect self-carepractice after renal transplantation. 
These problems adversely affect the quality of life in physical, psychological,emotional, and social aspects. 
Therefore, nurses need to be aware of the importance of self-care ability developmentin renal transplantation patients under the discharge phase. 
This study aimed to develop Clinical Nursing Practice Guidelines (CNPG) for self-care ability development in renaltransplantation patients in the discharge phase who had end-stage renal disease and were treated by renal transplantation.
The study group was adult patients, both male and female, more than 15 years old, and who were treated at the Facultyof Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University. 
The study was done by conducting analysis and synthesisof 12 research literatures together with 11 articles, and by adopting a supportive-educative nursing system as statedin Orem's nursing concept of practice.
This CNPG consists of four steps of development: 
1) nurses build a goodrelationship with patient and patient's relatives; 
2) nurses perform the first evaluation of patient's knowledge; 
3) nurseseducate patient and patient's relatives; and 
4) nurses perform the second evaluation of patient's knowledge.
The guideline was validated by professional nurses for correctness, content coverage, and clinical practicality.
In conclusion, the professional nurses' opinion revealed that the practical guidelines for self-care ability developmentin renal transplantation patients under the discharge phase are clinically practicable.
