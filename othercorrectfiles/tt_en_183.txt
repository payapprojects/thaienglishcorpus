Because off social changes and advancement in medical technology, especially application of technology in health care systems, ethical dilemmas in caring for terminally ill patients may occure. 
The purpose of this study was to identify ethical dilemmas in the case of terminally ill patients, concerning veracity, truth telling, prolongation of life, euthanasia and hospice care. 
The conceptual framework is base on ethical theories and Buddhist ethics. 
The result of study indicated that, in western culture, moral judgment is based on deontological, teleological, duties-based and right-based theories, while moral judgment in Thai society is similar to that in western culture, but is also concerned with Buddhist ethics. 
In addition, some physicians and nurses perspective, moral judgment involves a patients situation, so Buddhist ethics and individual intuition are also employed.
