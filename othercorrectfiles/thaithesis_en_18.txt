This study aims at examining factors influencing theprogram layout of the A.M. and F.M.radio channels operated by theBangkok Based Territorial Defence Radio Broadcasting Station(TDRBS) during the private renting period from l987-1992. 
In thisqualitative research, data were collected by depth interviews andparticipation observation technique. 
The study indicates that since 1987, there have been twotypes of factors influencing the program layout planning:fixedfactors and related operation factors. 
Fixed factors include thebroadcast system, the target audience, the broadcast time and theradio producers. 
Related operation factors include the station'spolicy, the station management, the radio producers of the F.M.station, the media brokers, the station's regulations and theprogram evaluation process. 
Among these factors, the station'spolicy makers and the media brokers are considered as the mostinfluential factors. 
The problems in program layout planning occurred primarilyfrom the change in the management policy and from the fact thatthe staff do not have sufficient knowledge in program layoutplanning. 
To solve the problems the researcher suggests that thestation management should study and try to have a thoroughunderstanding of the radio station's management process. 
Inaddition, the station should assign staff members with knowledgeand experience in mass communications and program layout planninghandle the program layout planning job.
