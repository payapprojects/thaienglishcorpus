This study examines the level of activity of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the first six weeks after they were discharged, and the correlation between the level of activity and physical conditions, personal factors and social support. 
The subjects were 30 AMI patients who had been discharged from Siriraj Hospital and Ramathibodi Hospital. 
Data were collected by interview and questionnaire comprising patients health history, the level of activity after discharge and demographic data. 
The data were collected in hospitals prior to discharge and on the first, third, and sixth week following discharge from hospital. 
Frequency distribution, percentage, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, t-test and chi-square test were used to analyze the data. 
The findings revealed that none of the AMI patients had followed the recommended daily activity during the six weeks after discharge. 
They were at risk to have recurrent infarction in the first (80%) and third (96.6%) week following discharge. 
In the sixth week after discharge, they were at risk to have de-conditioning effects (86.7%). 
Age and social support were significantly associated with activity in the first week after discharge .
Whereas, at the sixth week after discharge, gender was significantly associated with activity .
These findings suggest that after discharge, activity at home may improve or deteriorate the health of patients. 
Nurses and health care teams should provide accurate and clear information about appropriate activities for AMI patients after hospital discharge. 
The information should be based on the knowledge of patients environment, residence, and their social support. 
Moreover, nurses should be sensitized to the difference between recovery activities and daily activity of working and retired patients as well as female patients.
