This thesis presents a design and development ofmanagement program for Batch Control Systems. 
Theprogram is based on Standard ISA-S88.01-1995 (BatchControl). 
Due to it's modular structure, the programcan be easily modified or expanded in the future. 
Thedeveloped program can be described in to Physical ModelEditor, Recipe Editor, Graphic for Represent RecipeProcedure, Phase and Procedure Monitor, CommunicationSystem Software between Microcomputer and PLC, etc. 
Theprogram language is based on Visual Basie. 
MicrosoftAccess is used as database software. 
The system which consists of IBM PC with developedsoftware and PLC has been tested in laboratory.
