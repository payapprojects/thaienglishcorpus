Those who have become amputees have physical, mental and psychosocial problems which force them to change their behavior and lifestyle in order to have normal self-dependent lives. 
The objectives of this survey research are to identify the perceived self-efficacy, perceived health status, and health promoting lifestyle of amputees and to study the relationships between demographic factors, perceived self-efficacy, perceived health status and health promoting lifestyle of amputees. 
The subjects of the study were 120 outpatient amputees who came to follow up at the prosthetic clinics at Siriraj, Lerd Sin and Pramongkutklao hospitals from April to October, 1997. 
The data were collected from patient records and using questionaires. 
The data were analysed with the SPSS/PC(+) program including the following statistics: frequencies, percentage, Chi-square and Pearsons Product Moment Correlation coefficient. 
These results show that most amputees had moderate perceived general self-efficacy scores. 
Most had moderate composite perceived specific self-efficacy scores, and composite health promoting lifestyle scores. 
There were statistically significant correlations between education, incomes, perceived general self-efficacy, perceived specific self-efficacy, perceived health status and composite health promoting lifestyle for the amputees. 
These results suggest that for improved quality of life for amputees, perceived self-efficacy and exercise should be promoted.
