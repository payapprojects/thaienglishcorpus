This thesis's describes the design,development andconstruction of Remote Data Acquisition and Control System viaRS-485. The design follows OSI standard with 2 layers.
Thephysical layer is according to RS-485 standard.
The data linklayer uses unbalance-congigured HDLC protocol in Normal ResponseMode(NRM).
The system consists of a primary station and 31secondary stations.
The primary station is served as Man MachineInterface and controls all the communications in the system.
Thesecondary stations response to the command sent by the primarystation.
There are 5 types of secondary stations:digitalinput,digital output,analog input,l-5 Vdc analog output and 0-10Vdc analog output.
Each digital I/O type can handle 16 signalswhile each analog I/O type can handle 6 signals.
Maximum speed of data transfer can be up to 7,200 bits persecond within 1,320 metre.
The test in laboratory shows satisfactory results.
Thesystem can be developed to be an industrial prototype.
