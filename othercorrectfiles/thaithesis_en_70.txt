This classroom-based research study was conducted to investigate the effects of the KMUTT students grammar self-studying in KMUTT SALC on their self-correction and on their written production. 
The subjects were 7 first-year students at KMUTT who enrolled in LNG 101: 
Fundamental English I. 
The instruments used were students written tasks, students record sheets and semi-structured interview. 
The findings of this study revealed that the students had developed in two aspects. 
Firstly, five out of seven students (71.43%) could self-correct assigned grammar points. 
The other aspect concerned the quality of their writing, that is, they were able to write more grammatically acceptable sentence structures. 
Moreover, the students were confident in writing more complicated and longer sentences. 
The increased quality of writing tasks was likely due to the suitability of learning processes, materials used, and the exercise types. 
They provided adequacy and quality of practice. 
Nevertheless, the degree of their success in self-studying and self-correction depended on teachers support in terms of counseling and learner training. 
Through this support, the students would be able to conduct self-study effectively.
