The purpose of this cross-sectional, survey research was to study the food consumption behavior of coronary heart disease patients and the patients demographic (sex, age, income, education) and psychosocial (perception of heart disease, values concerning fatty food consumption, family support) factors that influence fatty food consumption behavior. 
The sample consisted of 240 coronary heart disease patients in the heart disease clinic of Pramongkutklao Hospital. 
Data were collected through the administration of interviews that were developed by the researcher and data were analyzed, using the SPSS/PC+ program, in terms of frequencies, percentages, arithmetic means, standard t - scores, Pearsons Product Moment Correlation coefficients and multiple regression analysis. 
The results of this study showed that the majority of coronary heart disease patients decreased fatty foods consumption behavior but that they still engaged in behavior that puts them at risk of increasing their cholesterol levels (e.g., ingesting fried, deep fried and noodle - based foods). 
Approximately half of the subjects reported consuming foods on social occasions that negatively affected their health (fatty foods, alcohol and soft drinks). 
Psychosocial factors (values concerning fatty food consumption (+,b)= 0.6) and family support (+,b)=-1.2)) accounted for 42.1% of variance of fatty food consumption behavior among the subjects .
