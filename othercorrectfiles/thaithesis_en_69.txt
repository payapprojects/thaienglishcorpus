The subjects were requested to attend the experiment once a week for totally six consecutive times. 
In the first week, each student was assigned to do the pre-test. 
Then in the other four weeks the students were requested to read jokes, one unit per week. 
In each joke, there was a hyperlink for the multiple-meaning word, students were allowed to look at it on their will in order to help them understand the meaning. 
In the last week, all subjects were asked to do the post-test and had a semi-structured interview with the researcher.
